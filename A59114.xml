            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>HAving always thought, that the Doctrine of <hi>Paſſive Obedience,</hi> or <hi>Non-reſiſtance of our lawful Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors,</hi> had been a Doctrine founded in the Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, recommended to the Chriſtian World by the Precepts and Example of our Bleſſed Saviour, and the Practices of his more immediate Followers; which Copy the <hi>Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> hath exactly tranſcribed, to whoſe immortal Glory it muſt be ſaid, that She alone (in contra-diſtinction both to <hi>Papiſts</hi> and <hi>Diſſenters</hi>) hath aſſerted the Principles of Obedience to Princes, as the beſt Ages of Chriſtianity own'd, and practiſed it; and having lived ſo long to ſee that Doctrine ridicul'd, and call'd <hi>the Doctrine of the Bow-ſtring,</hi> and the Aſſertors and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſers of it exploded, as <hi>Old Lacrymiſts,</hi> and the matter of fact, as to the firſt Ages of the Reformation, denyed; while ſome affirm, that the Tenet was no older than <hi>Archbiſhop Laud,</hi> and was introduced by a few Court Biſhops,

Tho' S. <hi>Paul</hi> was certainly no Man-pleaſer, far from ſeeking himſelf, or from making merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize of the Word of God, or handling it deceitfully for filthy Lucre ſake, nor were there hopes of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment, when the Church had no ſetled Revenue, nor was there any Chriſtian Prince in the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal World; but he draws his Arguments from the <hi>Ordinance of God, the diſcharge of Duty, and a good Conſcience, the advancement of the Goſpel, and the honor of the Chriſtian Religion.</hi> See more in that admirable Preface.</note> the better to make way for the attainment, and eſtabliſhing of their own Grandeur; by reaſon of which, the Enemies of our Communion (both <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> and others) have confidently averred, that our Obedience to our Sovereigns is nothing but our Intereſt, and that we have vindicated the Rights of Kings, becauſe they
<pb facs="tcp:64059:103"/>have vindicated the Rights of our Church, and have proſecuted all that diſlik'd our Conſtitutions: I could no longer forbear writing in the behalf of that truth which is eternal and unalter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able (as are all the Doctrines of Chriſtianity, tho we muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg to our ſhame, that they are more illuſtrious in our Books, than in our Lives) and ſhewing, that from the infancy of the happy Reformation, the <hi>Church of England</hi> hath always believed and avowed, <q>That it is the duty of every Chriſtian, in things lawful, <hi>actively</hi> to obey his Superior; in things unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, to <hi>ſuffer</hi> rather than obey, and in any caſe, or upon any pretence whatſoever not to reſiſt, becauſe, whoever does ſo, <hi>ſhall receive to themſelves Damnation.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Nor can the Doctrine be unſeaſonable, ſince no Government can be ſafe without it, Mens Paſſions naturally inclining them to think well of themſelves, and to make Complaints of hard <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſage, even then when they are moſt gently treated; what In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances have we in the Writings of the laſt Ages? When <hi>Parſons.</hi> in the name of his Party, reſolving to expoſe the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable Reign of Q. <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> renders her worſe than the worſt of Tyrants, and asks, <q>Where are the <hi>Neroes</hi> and <hi>Diocleſians,</hi> where are the <hi>Genſerics</hi> and <hi>Hunnerics;</hi>
                     </q> As if neither <hi>Pagan</hi> nor <hi>Arian</hi> Perſecutors were as cruel as ſhe?

When the diſaffected Jews could ſay, <hi>We have no por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in David, nor any inheritance in the Son of Jeſſe, every man to his tents, O Iſrael:</hi> And yet that Prince was of Gods own immediate deſignation, and a Man after Gods own heart. Now if upon ſuch Pretenſions Subjects may right themſelves by reſiſting their lawful Superiours, how ſoon will a fruitful Land be turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into a barren Wilderneſs, and Paradiſe it ſelf become a Field of Blood? And I have with ſome regret and confuſion reflected here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore, that in the <hi>Romiſh Communion, Preſton, Widdrington,</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:64059:103"/>and <hi>Barnes</hi> in <hi>England; VValſh</hi> and <hi>Caron</hi> in <hi>Ireland;</hi> and in <hi>Scotland Barclay</hi> (to omit other Countries) all profeſt Papiſts (and all but <hi>Barclay</hi> Prieſts, and conſequently more obliged to uphold the Grandeur of the Pontifical Chair) ſhould honeſtly and ſtoutly appear to the Vindication of this Truth, which we ſeem ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther weary or aſham'd of.

                  <p>Did we ſeriouſly ſtudy the Laws of Providence, and conſider the indiſpenſible Obligations laid on us of taking up the Croſs; did we remember, that Affliction is the Churches Portion, and that not the leaſt Evil may be done to procure the greateſt Good; this

                     <hi>Creſſy</hi> makes it one of the moſt cogent Reaſons, why he (when he vainly thought the <hi>Church of England</hi> quite deſtroyed, ſo as never to be reſtored) could not communicate with other Proteſtant Churches, becauſe they, (tho in that Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation he falſifies and calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niates, as I ſhall make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in the following Diſcourſe) taught men, <hi>That it was law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to take Arms in defence of Religion, and that when Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces perſecuted the Truth, their Subjects were no longer bound to obey them.</hi> Nor is <hi>Creſſy</hi> the only Perſon of the Popiſh Communion who hath laid this Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation at the door of the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> tho without Reaſon or Juſtice, while the <hi>Romiſh Church</hi> in one of her General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils determins the Depoſition of Princes, who are not in all things obedient to her Injunctions. And I hope no man can imagin that I intend to promote any diſturbance by this Writing: <hi>1.</hi> Becauſe I only do the office of an Hiſtorian (not wilfully miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quoting any Paſſage, nor citing it contrary to the Authors in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention and meaning, as far as I underſtand it; and this alſo
<pb facs="tcp:64059:105"/>muſt excuſe me from being obliged to make good every Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from Authority or Reaſon, which my Authors uſe; for that Province thoſe of my Authors which are alive, are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to manage, or to acknowledg their Miſtakes) I intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only to ſhew the concurrent Teſtimony of our greateſt Men in this momentous Point. <hi>2.</hi> Becauſe I am told,
<note n="a" place="margin">Dr. <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net</hi>'s Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Martyr, page 6.</note> that the <hi>Incendiary and Incendiariſm were among the much abuſed words of the late times, yet thoſe were the great Incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diaries who kindled God's wrath; and that it is from ſuch that we may juſtly fear the like, or rather ſeverer Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, if our Sins be greater than they were then.</hi> i. e. When under the ſpecious Pretexts of Liberty and Religion they firſt oppoſed, and then murdered the <hi>Lord's Anointed. 3.</hi> Becauſe he who preaches up the Neceſſity of Suffering, and the <hi>Unlawfulneſs of Reſiſting Superiors,</hi> and who avers, that the Goſpel teaches the followers of our Bleſſed Saviour to dye, but not to fight for Religion, is little likely to be a Diſturber of Government, whoſe Original he acknowledges to be only from Heaven, and accountable only to that Tribunal.</p>
                  <p>For at laſt it will be found true, that no Government can be ſafe, while thoſe who live under it, do not own this Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, <hi>That it is not lawful upon any Pretence whatſoever, to take Arms againſt our Lawful Sovereign;</hi> ſince he, who is Obedient and Loyal only becauſe his Compliance advances his Deſigns (either of Profit, Pleaſure, Honor, Revenge, or any other Luſt) as ſoon as his Point is gained, his Duty ceaſes; but he who is obedient to his Sovereign,
<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Tenniſon, Hobbs's Creed.</hi> p. 159. Except a Man obey for <hi>Conſcience ſake,</hi> all the Cords of outward Pacts and Covenants will not hold him, when he dreams that the Philiſtines are upon him, and that he can deliver himſelf by force from the power of his Enemies, in which number the Prince himſelf is reckoned by ambitious Subjects out of favor. — Mr. <hi>Pelling's</hi> Sermon, <hi>Jan.</hi> 30. 1683. p. 43. Some are for the King, as long as he is rich, powerful, able to maintain their Intereſt; this is the Loyalty of the Leviathan, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </note> becauſe he is God's Vicegerent, and becauſe God hath obliged him to be ſubject, <hi>not only for wrath, but for conſcience ſake,</hi> can never be ſhook from his good reſolutions, and will be unalterably true to his Oaths and his Duty.</p>

                  <p> And when ſo many Men eminent for their Piety, Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Station have unanimouſly agreed in delivering their Sentiments in this Point, to ſay, that whatever they ſaid or did, was to gratifie or advance their ambitious or covetous Appetites (as if their Honeſty, like Quickſilver in a Weather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glaſs, roſe higher or ſunk lower, as the day proved clear or clou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy) is to bring an unjuſt Scandal on the Church and her moſt il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious Champions, Men of great Probity and Wiſdom, as the greateſt Hypocrites and Time-ſervers in the World, who ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed their Conſciences to their Deſires of growing rich and powerful, while had the Times been contrary to them, they would have owned other Principles: This Imputation I ſhall wipe off, and ſhew, that even in the worſt of times, in the <hi>Marian</hi> Perſecution, this Doctrine was publickly own'd and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted, when contrary to the Laws of Nature and Humanity, and the Rules of Chriſtian Equity, the Proteſtants were moſt cruelly harras'd: 'Tis true, the Devil ſaid to God of <hi>Job, Turn thy hand againſt him, and he will curſe thee to thy face;</hi> but it was the Devil that ſaid it, and he was a Lyar from the beginning, and ſo it proved in the Caſe of <hi>Job;</hi> for when God altered his Methods, and treated the good Man, as if he had been his Enemy, <hi>Job</hi> was always the ſame, <hi>perfect, and upright, one that feared God, and eſchewed evil.</hi>

                  <p>In this Catalogue I purpoſely omit Biſhop <hi>Manwaring</hi> and <hi>Sibthorp</hi> in the Reign of <hi>CHARLES I.</hi> and Biſh. <hi>Parker, Cartwright, &amp;c.</hi> in the Reign of <hi>JAMES II.</hi> becauſe their Authorities were in their own times excepted againſt, as of Men that did not write ſoberly on the Subject, reſolving for the moſt part, to appeal to the Writings of ſuch Men, who have been, and are eſteemed the unqueſtionable true and orthodox Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Religion againſt her <hi>Romiſh</hi> Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; and if ſuch Authorities will not encline, and the Reaſons of ſuch eminent Authors perſwade the Reader to be of my Opinion, I ſhall only ſay, I am ſorry that I have loſt my labor.</p>

                        <hi>WHen Judicious Men undertake to determine what are the Doctrines of any Church, they do not guide themſelves by the Practices, nor the Writings of ſome of her Members, but by the Poſitions which ſhe hath publickly owned and aſſerted, and the Practices that are conſonant there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto; this being agreeable to the Counſel of our holy Saviour, who when he bids us</hi>
                        <note n="*" place="margin">Mat. 7.15, 16.</note> To beware of falſe Prophets, who came in Sheeps Cloathing, but inwardly are ravening Wolves, <hi>cautions us,</hi> that we ſhall know them by their fruits, <hi>i.e. Not by the Fruits of their Lives, but of their Doctrines. So does

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:64059:108"/>how great, and haughty ſoever, by the Fruits they produce, which Rule is not to be underſtood concerning the particular Actions of Men, which have no reſpect to their Doctrines; for as S. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> obſerves, many Hereticks have been Men of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Lives,' and ſo on the contrary—but we are to underſtand it of thoſe Fruits which their Doctrines have a direct influence upon; and therefore the Rule hath a particular reſpect to two things, by which we are to examine the faireſt Pretences: 1. The Deſign they end to. 2. The Means made uſe of for the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Deſign. If therefore the Deſign be quite of another Nature from that of the Goſpel, if the means be ſuch as are directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to it, we may from thence juſtly infer, that how plauſible ſoever the pretences are, how fine and ſoft ſoever <hi>the Sheeps cloathing</hi> be, that <hi>inwardly they are ravening wolves. Thus that great Man determines it againſt the Jeſuits in the very caſe of reſiſting, excommunicating, depoſing and murdering Princes; and ſo do we all judge concerning the</hi> Church of Rome, <hi>many of her Members are doubtleſs loyal and peaceable, but their Church teaches them otherwiſe in the famous Lateran Council;

                        <hi>this Church hath in matters of Controverſie Articles ſo penned and framed after the Holy Scriptures, and grounded upon the true underſtanding of God's Word, that in ſhort time, if they had been univerſally received,</hi> ſays Biſhop <hi>Ridley</hi> the Martyr, <hi>they ſhould have been able to have ſet in Chriſt's Church much concord and unity in Chriſt's true Religion, and to have expelled many falſe Errors and Hereſies, wherewith this Church, alas! was almoſt overgone.</hi> Nor is this that excellent Prelate's peculiar Opinion, but of the whole Church, which ordains,

                        <hi>Anno</hi> 1552. In the Convocation held at <hi>London,</hi> Articles of Religion were agreed upon, of which the Thirty ſixth runs thus,</p>
                     <p>
                        <q>The Civil Magiſtrate is ordained, and allowed of God — and therefore is to be obeyed not only for wrath, but alſo for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſake</q> — <hi>And expreſly aſſerts,</hi>

                     <p>In the Articles of our Church under Queen <hi>Eliſabeth, anno.</hi> 1562. it runs thus, and ſo continues to this day.</p>
                     <p>
                        <q>The Queens Majeſty hath the chief Power in this Realm of <hi>England,</hi> and other her Dominions, unto whom the chief Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of all Eſtates of this Realm, whether they be Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical, or Civil, in all Caſes doth appertain, and is not, nor ought to be ſubject to any Foreign Juriſdiction.</q>

<note n="‖" place="margin">
                           <hi>Rogers</hi>'s Praef. to the 39th. Artic.</note> that theſe Articles of 1562. were pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed in the ſame year, in which the Maſſacre at <hi>Vaſſey</hi> in <hi>France</hi>
                        <pb n="4" facs="tcp:64059:109"/>was committed by the <hi>Duke of Guiſe,</hi> and when all the Proteſtants in the Country were ſentenced to Death by the <hi>Parliament of Paris.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is true, this Doctrine is not limited to the particular Caſe of Subjects taking up Arms, but it ſeems to me by two neceſſary Conſequences to be deduc'd from it. 1. Becauſe if the Pope, who pretended by a Divine Right, had no power over Kings, much leſs have the People any power, who pretend to an inferior Right, that of Compact. 2. Becauſe the <hi>Article</hi> makes no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction, but excludes all other Power, as well as that of the Pope. And in truth, the Plea is the ſame on either ſide; the Pope ſays, as long as the Prince governs according to the Laws of God, and the Church (of which he is the Interpreter) ſo long the Cenſures of the Church do not reach him; and ſay the People, as long as the Prince governs according to the Laws of the Land (and of the meaning of thoſe Laws themſelves are the Interpreters) ſo long are they bound to be obedient; but as ſoon as the King doth any thing that may contradict the Pope, then he is (deſervedly, ſay the <hi>Romaniſts</hi>) excommunicate, depoſed and murdered; and when he uſurps upon the Peoples Liberties, then he ought to be depoſed by the Peoples; the Arguments on either ſide are the ſame, and for the moſt part the Authorities; for (as
<note n="*" place="margin">Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat. of the Church of <hi>England, ann.</hi> 17. §. 19. p. 481.</note> Dr. <hi>Puller</hi> well obſerves) <hi>both Papiſts and Diſſenters deny the Supremacy of the King, one attributes it to the Pope originally; the other to the People: and the ſame Arguments that the Pope uſeth for his Supremacy over Kings, the Diſciplinarians uſe for eſtabliſhing their Sovereignty.</hi>

                     <p>At laſt the <hi>Injunctions</hi> were called <hi>Canons,</hi> and the firſt Canon <hi>An.</hi> 1603. in the firſt Year of King <hi>James,</hi> is the ſame in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:64059:110"/>with the <hi>Injunction</hi> of <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth, and Queen <hi>Elizabeth;</hi> and for this reaſon, Can. 55. it is ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, That <hi>every Miniſter ſhould before his Sermon acknowledge the King to be in all Cauſes, and over all Perſons, ſupreme Head and Governor,</hi> in more expreſs terms than were formerly uſed.</p>
                     <p>But particularly I look upon the <hi>Canons</hi> of the Year 1640. to be a full Explanation of the belief of our Church in this point. <q>Now <hi>Can.</hi> 1. injoyns all former Laws, Ordinances, and Conſtitutions for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly made for the acknowledgment and profeſſion of the moſt lawful and independent Authority of our dread Sovereign Lord the King's moſt excellent Majeſty, to be carefully obſerved, and then deſcends to give an Explanation of the Royal Power and Authority; That the moſt ſacred Order of Kings is of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Right, being the Ordinance of God himſelf, founded in the prime Laws of Nature, and clearly eſtabliſh'd by expreſs Texts both of the Old and New Teſtament: and for any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or Perſons to ſet up, maintain, or allow, in any their ſaid Realms or Territories reſpectively, under any pretence whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, any independent coactive Power, either Papal or Popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, (whether directly or indirectly) is to undermine their great Royal Office, and cunningly to overthrow that moſt Sacred Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, which God himſelf hath eſtabliſh'd, and ſo is treaſonable againſt God, as well as againſt the King. For Subjects to bear Arms againſt their Kings,
<note place="margin">See the Doctrine of theſe Canons vindicated in Dr. <hi>Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler</hi>'s Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derat. of the Ch. of <hi>Engl.</hi> c. 12. §. 6. p. 34.</note> offenſive or defenſive, upon any Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence whatſoever, is at leaſt to reſiſt the Powers which are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained of God; and though they do not invade, but only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt, </q> St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells them plainly, <hi>They ſhall receive to themſelves Damnation:</hi> while in the next Paragraph they ſhew, that this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine does not intitle the King to every Man's Eſtate.</p>
                     <p>But againſt the Synod, that made theſe Canons, lies a great Objection (tho I ſhould have thought, that the hard Cenſures of it might have been ſpar'd, becauſe no Synod of our Church, and perhaps none of any other <hi>Proteſtant Church</hi> hath ſo expreſly condemn'd <hi>Popery,</hi> and <hi>Socinianiſm,</hi> the great Enemies of true Reformed Chriſtianity, as this Synod hath done
<note n="‖" place="margin">V.

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:64059:110"/>dependent on the meeting of the States at the ſame time. I anſwer; Firſt, that theſe Canons were made, and confirm'd in full Convocation of both Provinces of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and <hi>York,</hi> and the making of Canons being a work properly Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, theſe Canons were made by the Repreſentatives of the whole Clergy of this Kingdom. 2. The Canons were confirm'd by the King (which was all that was of old required in ſuch Caſes) and tho the <hi>Convocation</hi> ſat after the Diſſolution of the Parliament, yet, 1. This is not without Preſident even in the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Days of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> not to look back into <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. or the primitive Times. And 2. the Perſons, who condemn'd this Synod are well known to have done it to juſtifie their own Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, being reſolved to ruine Epiſcopacy (and with it the Monarchy) and afterward by their own power they called an <hi>Aſſembly</hi> of <hi>Divines,</hi> and What a Confeſſion of Faith, what Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, Rites, and Methods did they Eſtabliſh? a <hi>Directory</hi> among other things, out of which they left the <hi>Lord's Prayer</hi> (perhaps becauſe it 'twas a Form) the <hi>Apoſtles Creed</hi> (becauſe themſelves thought they could make a better) and the Ten Commandments (becauſe the fifth plainly accuſed them of Rebellion againſt their Lawful Prince). And it is worth the obſerving that Sr. <hi>Edward Deering</hi>'s Speeches that were ſpoken with ſo much Virulence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this Synod (and afterwards Printed) were by the Order of the ſame Houſe, who firſt applauded them, decreed to be Burnt by the hand of the Common Hang-man. And if it be ſtill objected, that the Canons were Reprobated ſince the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of <hi>Charles</hi> II. I ſay, that I quote them, not as a Law, that obliges the <hi>Church,</hi> but as the known Senſe of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> at that time.</p>

Governors) <hi>as God's Miniſters, although they be evil, not only for fear, but alſo for conſcience ſake: and here, good People, let us mark diligently, that it is not lawful for Inferiors and Subjects <hi>in any caſe</hi> to reſiſt, and ſtand againſt the ſuperior Powers; for St.</hi> Paul<hi>'s words be plain, That whoſo withſtandeth ſhall get to themſelves Damnation.</hi> Our Saviour <hi>Chriſt and his Apoſtles received many and divers Injuries of the unfaithful and wicked men in Authority;</hi> yet we never read, <hi>that they, or any of them, cauſed any Sedition or Rebellion againſt Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: we read oftne, that they patiently ſuffer'd all Troubles, Vexati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Slanders, Pangs, Pains, and Death it ſelf obediently, without Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult or Reſiſtance. Chriſt taught us plainly, that even the wicked
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:64059:111"/>Rulers have their Power and Authority from God; and therefore it is not lawful for their Subjects to withſtand them, although they abuſe their Power. Let us believe undoubtedly (good Chriſtian People) that we may not obey Kings,—if they command us to do any thing contrary to God's Commandments, in ſuch a caſe we ought to ſay with the Apoſtle,</hi> We muſt rather obey God than Man; <hi>but nevertheleſs, in that caſe we may <hi>not in any wiſe</hi> withſtand violently, or rebel againſt Rulers, or make any Inſurrection, Sedition, or Tumults, either by force of Arms, or otherwiſe, againſt the Anointed of the Lord, or any of his appointed Officers; but we muſt in ſuch caſe patiently ſuffer all wrongs and injuries, referring the judgment of our Cauſe only to God: and</hi> Part 3. of the ſame Homily. <hi>Ye have heard before of this Sermon of good Order and Obedience, manifeſtly proved both by Scriptures and Examples, that all Subjects are bound to obey their Magiſtrates, and <hi>for no cauſe</hi> to reſiſt, or withſtand, or rebel, or make any Sedition againſt them, yea, although they be wicked men.</hi>

<note n="*" place="margin">Part. 1.</note> 
                        <hi>In reading the holy Scriptures we ſhall find in very many, and almoſt infinite places, as well of the Old Teſtament as of the New, that Kings and Princes, as well the evil as the good, do reign by God's Ordinance, and that Subjects are bounden to obey them. The further and further any Earthly Prince doth ſwerve from the Example of the Heavenly Government, the greater plague he is of God's Wrath and Puniſhment, by God's Juſtice unto the Country and People over whom God for their Sins hath placed ſuch a Prince and Governor. What ſhall Subjects do then? What a perillous thing were it to commit to Subjects the Judgment, which Prince is wiſe and godly, and his Government good, and which otherwiſe? as though the Foot muſt judge of the Head; an Enterprize very heinous, and which muſt needs breed Rebellion; — and is not Rebellion the greateſt of all miſchiefs?—A Rebel is worſe than the worſt Prince, and Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion worſe than the worſt Government of the worſt Prince that hitherto hath been.—If we will have an evil Prince, when God ſhall ſend ſuch a one, taken away, and a good one in his place, let us take away our Wickedneſs, which provoketh God to place ſuch a one over us. — Shall the Subjects both by their Wickedneſs provoke God for their deſerved puniſhment to give them an undiſcreet and evil Prince, and alſo rebel againſt him, and withal againſt God, who for the puniſhment of their Sins did give them ſuch a Prince.</hi> And this Doctrine is excellently
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:64059:112"/>inforc'd in the ſecond part of that Homily from the Example of King <hi>David</hi> in his Carriage towards <hi>Saul.</hi> And one reaſon per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps why theſe old plain Sermons are by ſome men deſpiſed, and evil ſpoken of, is, becauſe they ſo heartily recommend this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of <hi>Non-reſiſtance.</hi>

                        <hi>God is the only Judge of the Actions of Princes, ſince they are his Servants and Subſtitutes; to their own Maſter they muſt ſtand or fall, and are only accountable to his Tribunal: and therefore we have ſo much the more need to pray for them to their great Lord, that he would direct them to do well, and guide them who are to rule us, that this their mighty Prince may be in ſafety and in peace: for if it ſhould be otherwiſe (which God forbid) we neither will nor can oppoſe them, having no other Arms againſt our Prince but Prayers and Tears.

<note n="‡" place="margin">Id. p. 176. v. p. 225.</note> It is natural to the true Sons of the Church of</hi> England <hi>to love the King.—If a foreign Prince oppoſes our King, he is a Robber; if

<note n="*" place="margin">Ib. p. 226, 227.</note> 
                        <hi>That Rebellion is a ſin ſo contrary to Chriſtianity, that though the Primitive Chriſtians had all the Provocations imaginable, and Force ſufficient, they never offer'd to rebel.—So that they who do rebel have diveſted themſelves of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Principles, and almoſt of their Humanity too.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the Prayer for the Parliament, <hi>We may ſay of our Princes as</hi> Pliny <hi>ſaid of the good Emperor</hi> Trajan, <hi>they have freely yielded to rule by thoſe Laws to which nothing but their own goodneſs could oblige them; and doubtleſs the People of</hi> England <hi>ought to take it as an Act of Grace that their Kings have conſented to govern them on this manner.</hi>

                        <hi>We are to conſider that Kings bear God's Name, and act by his Power; and ſuch as rebel, do fight againſt God, oppoſe his Word, and reſiſt his Ordinance,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>In the occaſional Office for <hi>Nov.</hi> 5. we pray God, <hi>That the King may cut off all ſuch workers of Iniquity, as turn Religion into Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, and Faith into Faction.</hi> And in the Office for <hi>May</hi> 29. when we thank God for the Reſtoration of the Royal Family, we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech God to accept of our <hi>unfeigned Oblation of our ſelves, vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all holy Obedience in Thought, Word, and Work, unto the Divine Majeſty, and promiſing in him, and for him, all dutiful Allegiance to his anointed Servant, and to his Heirs for ever.</hi> And it is alſo obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable, the Proclamations relating to thoſe ſolemn times are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to be read, which are as full to this purpoſe as any thing can be: and by our Canons, when the Miniſter bids Prayer before his Sermon, to continue the belief of this Truth, he is bound to exhort the People, when they pray, to acknowledge the King <hi>to be in all Cauſes and over all Perſons, next and immediately under God ſupreme,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

The Directions are dated <hi>Aug.</hi> 4. 1622. of which the firſt requires, <q>That no Preacher, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſhall fall into any ſet courſe, or common place, otherwiſe than by opening the Coherence, and diviſion of his Text, which ſhall not be comprehended and warranted in eſſence, ſubſtance, effect, or natural inference, within ſome one of the Articles of Religion ſet forth <hi>Ann.</hi> 1562.</q> or in ſome one of the Homilies ſet forth by Authority, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The fourth is, <q>That no Preacher, of what Title or Denomination ſoever, ſhall preſume from henceforth in any Auditory within this Kingdom, to declare, limit, or bound out by way of poſitive Doctrine, in any Lecture or Sermon, the Power, Prerogative, Juriſdiction, Authority, or duty of Sovereign Princes, or therein meddle with Matters of State, and Reference between Princes and People, than as they are inſtructed in the <hi>Homily of Obedience,</hi> and in the reſt of the <hi>Homilies,</hi> and <hi>Articles of Religion,</hi> ſet forth by Publick Authority.</q>

                           <q>For when <hi>Wyat</hi> made his Proclamation at <hi>Maidſtone,</hi> he profeſſed, that he intended nothing but to preſerve the Liberty of the Nation, and keep it from coming under the Yoke of Strangers, which he ſaid all the Council except one or two were againſt, and aſſured the People, that all the Nobility and chief Men of <hi>England</hi> would concur with him.</q> (Now the Generality of the Nation was then Papiſt, the Nobility and Gentry eſpecially, and ſo could not be preſumed to take Arms for the Proteſtant Religion.) <q>He ſaid nothing of Religion, but in private aſſured thoſe that were for the Reformation, that he would declare for them. — And his Demands

<note place="margin">☞</note> who but the King ſhall have it?

<note place="margin">☜</note> for in purſuance of this Oath to repel foreign Power we are in Arms at this day. To whom have we ſworn Allegiance but to God, and the King in reference to him? — We have ſworn, and will not repent to obey the King,

Our Saviour profeſſeth, <hi>My Kingdom is not of this World,</hi> and adds, <hi>for then would my Servants fight:</hi> which words, as they evince that it is lawful for Subjects to fight at the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of their temporal King for the maintenance of his world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Eſtate; ſo they do inſinuate, that Chriſt's Kingdom, being ſpiritual, muſt not be advanced by temporal Arms.

<note place="margin">P. 60.</note> profeſſing, we do not puniſh any Hereticks with Death, but Seminaries for Sedition and Rebellion.

                        <p>Anno 1646. <hi>Richard Overton</hi> (the famous Leveller) deck'd with many fantaſtick Titles, printed a Pamphlet, intituled, <hi>An Arrow againſt all Tyrants and Tyranny; wherein the Original, Riſe, Extent, and End of Magiſterial Power, the Natural and National Rights, Freedoms, and Properties of Mankind, are diſcover'd, and undeniably maintain'd, and the late Encroachments of the Lords over the Commons legally condemn'd.</hi> Out of which, that the Principles of ſuch Men may be made known, I ſhall tranſcribe a few paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. <q>To every individual in Nature is given an individual Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty by Nature, not to be invaded or uſurp'd by any; for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one as he is himſelf, ſo he hath a ſelf-propriety, elſe he could not be himſelf. — No Man hath Power over my Rights, and Liberties, and I over no Man's. — If I preſume any farther, I am an Encroacher, and an Invader upon another Man's Right, to which I have no Right; for by natural Birth all Men are equal and alike, born to like Property, Liberty, and Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. — No Man naturally would be fooled of his Liberty by his Neighbor's Craft, or enſlaved by his Neighbor's Might; for it is Nature's Inſtinct to preſerve it ſelf from all things hurtful and obnoxious. — And from this fountain or root all juſt hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Powers take their Original, not immediately from God (as Kings uſually plead their Prerogative) but mediately by the hand of Nature, as from the Repreſented to the Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters — no more may be communicated than is conducive to a better Being, more Safety and Freedom: he that gives more ſins againſt his own Fleſh; and he that takes more is a Thief, and a Robber to his kind, every Man being by nature a King, Prieſt, and Prophet in his own natural Circuit and Compaſs, whereof no ſecond may partake but by Deputation, Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and free Conſent from him whoſe natural Right and

The</hi> The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bean <hi>Legion were all Chriſtians; when the Emperor commanded the whole Army to offer Sacrifice to falſe Gods, they removed their Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, that they might, if poſſible, avoid the occaſion of diſpleaſing the Emperor.

But the Ungodly begin their Wickedneſs chiefly in the Contempt of Magiſtrates, when they hear how God blames and reproves them in the holy Scriptures; but it belongs to the divine Office to find fault with Magiſtrates, and to rebuke them; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore tho thou heareſt it, yet do not imitate it, for thou art not God, nor the Ordainer, no nor the Reformer, nor the Reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer of the divine Ordinance: but as God reproves them, ſo thee alſo in the holy Scriptures, that thou may'ſt do thy duty, and not meddle with what belongs to them. — The meaning there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of <hi>Solomon</hi> is, I have ſpoken much of Princes, how they undo the World, but do thou reverence them notwithſtanding that, for they are not an humane Ordinance, but a divine. St. <hi>Peter</hi> indeed calls the King an <hi>Humane Creature,</hi> becauſe he is aſſumed from among men, but his Authority is divine: and tho Princes be bad, they are to be honored, becauſe of this Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of God. Why then wilt thou ſpeak evil of thoſe who are vexed with ſo many and great cares and labours for thy Peace, if they be good? And if they be bad and fooliſh, their own Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety is miſchief enough to them, and brings them into ſufficient danger.

                              <hi>Abſalom</hi> accompliſh'd his deſign, partly by declaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt the Maleadminiſtrations of his Father's Government, partly by promiſing them a thorough Reformation, if ever he ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived to be a Judge in <hi>Iſrael.</hi> — Every Man knows, or might eaſily know, if he were not extremely wanting to himſelf, that his King is the Vicegerent of his God, and that being ſo, he is indiſpenſibly obliged by all the ties of Reaſon and Religion to ſubmit to his Will, and reverence his Perſon, and bow to his Authority, and that he cannot lift up his hand againſt him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fighting againſt God himſelf; the Truth of which is as ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious to our natural Reaſon, and as plainly aſſerted in holy Scripture, as of any Propoſition in Religion:
<note place="margin">☜</note> ſo that I dare bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affirm, a Man may find as many Pretexts for any Vice what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, even for Drunkenneſs, Whoredom, or Perjury, as ever were made for Rebellion; and were I to ſet up for a publick Patron of Wickedneſs, I hardly know a Villany in nature ſo black and monſtrous, which I could not more plauſibly recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend to Mens Reaſon and Conſciences, than this of <hi>Reſiſtance againſt lawful Authority;</hi> which is ſuch a complication of Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, ſuch a loathſome mixture of helliſh Ingredients, as is enough to nauſeate any Conſcience but a Devil's. And tho Conſcience
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:64059:160"/>and Religion are the Colors it uſually marches under, yet is the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſture of this Pretence ſo fulſome and bare-fac'd, that no Man in his Wits can be innocently abuſed by it; for certainly that Man muſt have a great mind to rebel, his Will muſt have a ſtrong Byaſs of Pride, or Diſcontent, Faction, or Ambition in it, that in deſpite of all the evidence from Reaſon and Scripture to the contrary, can perſuade himſelf that it is lawful for him, and much leſs,
<note place="margin">P. 15, 16.</note> that it is his duty, to lift up his hand againſt his So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign. And therefore for Men to appeal to God in a Cauſe ſo apparently wicked, is not ſubmiſſively to refer themſelves to him, but openly to mock and affront him, and to make a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xatious Appeal to God's Judgment again in a Caſe which he hath ſo often and ſo expreſly judged already, is a common Barretry; 'tis not to conſult, but to tempt him, and under pretence of ſubmitting to his determinations, openly to defie his Authority; in effect, it is to appeal from his Will to his Providence, and to beſpeak him to declare himſelf againſt his own Declarations.— In the caſe of Rebellion there is not only a peremptory Diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to thoſe Laws of God which require our dutiful Submiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to our lawful Superiors,
<note place="margin">☞</note> but alſo a direct Renuntiation of the divine Authority it ſelf; for all Sovereign Power is imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately founded in the Dominion of God, who being the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Lord of the World, no perſon can have right to govern in his Kingdom under him, but by Commiſſion from him. Kings therefore are only accountable to him;
<note place="margin">P. 17.18.</note> and if ſo, then for any of their Subjects to preſume to call them to account by a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick form'd reſiſtance, is to arraign God's own Authority, and invade his peculiar; it is to thruſt him out of his Throne, and ſet themſelves down in it; and then to ſummon his Authority before them, and require it to ſubmit its awful Head to their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perious doom and ſentence. While therefore we behave our ſelves factiouſly and rebelliouſly towards thoſe whom God hath ſet over us, we live as Out-laws in the Kingdom of God, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any reſpect to that viſible Authority by which he governs the World: and if this be ſo, then for Subjects to rebel againſt their Prince, is neither better nor worſe than to appeal to God againſt his own Authority, and to put this impious Caſe to him, Whether it be he or they that have the Right of Governing the World.</q>

                                 <q>Our great miſtake is, that we dote too much upon theſe preſent Enjoyments, and are too fond of the things of this World, by which means it comes to paſs that we ſtretch the Principle of preſervation too far, and are often apt to conclude, that whatſoever ſeems fit and proper to work our preſent ſecurity, this we may lawfully and with a ſafe Conſcience do. Now al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though our preſent danger may ſeem great enough, altho Life, Fortune, Religion, all ſhould appear to be at ſtake, and we can imagine within our ſelves, that if ſuch and ſuch courſes were made uſe of, we might eſcape. Yet that we ought nevertheleſs to ſtand ſtill and make uſe of no means but ſuch as are honeſt and lawful, I ſhall endeavour to evince from theſe following Conſiderations. Firſt, Conſider, that by doing any unlawful action we deprive our ſelves of God's care and protection, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 2. Nothing can bring a greater ſcandal upon the Religion we profeſs, than for us to do any thing which is unlawful, although it be for our own preſervation. All Sects and Parties do in all their undertakings pretend Piety, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>— But our Saviour hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us a Caution not to judg of Men by their pretences, but by their actions <hi>&amp;c.</hi> — Whereſoever therefore we obſerve Men to
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:64059:164"/>be covetous, and full of ambition, to allow Superſtition and Idolatry, to be Factors for Schiſm and Rebellion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Let them talk as much as they pleaſe of the Glory of God, by their Fruits we know them, they are ravenous Wolves in Sheeps cloathing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> — We ſee how the Papiſts have miſrepreſented all our Actions, — And therefore nothing could be a greater gratification to them at this time, than to ſee us act any thing, which is either contrary to that duty which we owe to God, or that Allegiance which is due to our Soyereign: what pleaſure would they reap from an Inſurrection,
<note place="margin">Pag. 17.</note> or popular Tumults, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> — In vain do we call our ſelves Proteſtants, if we live otherwiſe than becomes true Chriſtians, neither ſhall we be ever able to excuſe our ſelves either to God or Man, if to keep out Popery we are not afraid wilfully to commit any ſin, or wickedneſs: ſuch a way of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding, as it would on the one Hand confirm the Proſelytes of Popery, and hinder them from renouncing their groſs abſurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, ſo would it on the other Hand harden the Atheiſt in his looſe, and debaucht Principles, who with more boldneſes than for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly would aſſert, that Religion was a trick of State, ſince the moſt Zealous Profeſſors of it took ſo little care to obſerve its Precepts, and that Heaven, and the pleaſures of another World were only Fable and Romance, ſince they who talk'd ſo much of them (whether Papiſts or Proteſtants) had nevertheleſs ſuch a tender regard to the comforts of this life, and ſo kind a reſpect to their preſent Eſtates, and Fortunes, that for the preſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of theſe later, they did not ſcruple venturing the forfeiture of the former. — If therefore we have any kindneſs for that Religion we profeſs, if we would not make the name of Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants as deſpicable as that of Papiſts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Let us keep within thoſe bounds of Duty which are ſet us, and although our condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may appear deſperate,
<note place="margin">☞</note> let us reſolve not to uphold it by any other means than what are allowed by God himſelf: his glory will be ſooner advanced, and true Religion better propagated by ſuffering wrong, than doing wickedly. And therefore it was the conſtant practice of the Primitive Chriſtians to ſubmit to the moſt cruel Tortures, rather than by any unwarrantable action ſtrive to avoid them: neither were there any more ſeverely cenſured a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, than ſuch who at any time for fear of Perſecution warpt from their Duty, by tamely complying with any Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theniſh Cuſtom.

<pb n="115" facs="tcp:64059:164"/>Profeſſors to be guilty of ſuch practices, as are moſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly repugnant to their own Principles. 3. Conſider, that to do evil, though for our own preſervation, inſtead of procuring our peace, and ſettlement, would be moſt likely to unſettle, and ruin us; for having once broken down the fences of Duty, which are placed about us, who can tell where we ſhall ſtop or abide? Having allowed our ſelves the liberty of doing one ſinful action, we may eaſily be prompted on to commit a thouſand; for the ſame pretences will juſtifie all ſins alike, and if for the ſake of Religion a Tumult may lawfully be raiſed, a Rebellion alſo may be promoted, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                              <p>Religion is in danger, and like to be undermined by the cloſe and ſubtle Arts, or overborn by the more <hi>open</hi> and powerful vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of ſtrong and witty Enemies. And this is <hi>God's Cauſe,</hi> and Chriſt our Lord and Saviour's <hi>Intereſt.</hi> So that whatever is done here, we think is in Service of our Maker. If we fight it is his Battels.—Some on one Hand that call us Hereticks—think no means ſinful whereby they can weaken and divide. And others again even of our <hi>own</hi> ſelves, who juſtly abhor theſe damnable Inſtances of Diſobedience, upon pretence of preſerving or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagating Religion, in ſome <hi>furious and firy ſpirited</hi> ſort of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts (for God forbid, that we ſhould think them all to be of this temper) do yet run into the ſame extravagance, which upon ſo great reaſon they condemn in them.</p>
                              <p>For if we look into our zeal for the <hi>common Religion</hi> of <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants,</hi> we ſhall find, that we tranſgreſs many, and thoſe moſt <hi>material</hi> and <hi>weighty</hi> Laws of it, whilſt we expreſs our <hi>affection</hi> and <hi>concern</hi> to <hi>defend</hi> and <hi>preſerve</hi> it.</p>
                              <p>For doth not this <hi>pretence</hi> of <hi>preſerving</hi> our <hi>Religion,</hi> carry us beyond all the Bounds of <hi>Peaceableneſs and good Subjection?</hi>

                              <p>Yea, I add further, that theſe ſame Fears for our endangered Religion tranſport us into the Tranſgreſſion of ſundry weighty Laws, which oblige us towards our very Enemies, who have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived to deſtroy us.</p>

                              <p>But if Men would conſider calmly, and have patience to look beyond the ſurface and bare outſides of things, they would ſoon diſcern the vanity of this pretence, and how far it will be from excuſing any ſuch ſinful and diſobedient Practices, as they think to juſtifie and warrant by it.</p>
                              <p>For as for <hi>true</hi> and <hi>ſubſtantial Religion,</hi> for protection whereof they would be thought to venture upon all theſe Tranſgreſſions, it ſtands in no need of their help to <hi>preſerve it in perſecuting times,</hi> altho they ſhould uſe <hi>innocent</hi> and juſt <hi>means,</hi> not ſuch as are ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and diſobedient; it would live then without their care, and whether they went about by any <hi>politick</hi> means to preſerve it or no.

<note place="margin">☞</note> Could the violence of Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion have <hi>oppreſſed</hi> our <hi>Religion,</hi> it had been ſtifled in the Birth.

                              <p>It is not Religion then, whatever Men may vainly pretend, that makes them run into the Breach of Laws, and Contempt of Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, leſt they ſhould ſuffer in the <hi>profeſſion</hi> of it.

                  <head type="sub">Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet,</hi> In his Preface to the Jeſuits Loyalty.</head>
                  <p>THE ſame Learned Author, expoſing the abſurd, and inconſiſtent pretences of Loyalty in the Jeſuits, makes choice of this method. "To run the Parallel between the Depoſing Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth Principles, which he undertakes to prove, and effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually makes out to agree in theſe three particulars. <q>1.
<note place="margin">Pag. 4.</note> In ſetting up a Court of Judicature over Sovereign Princes. 2. In breaking the Oaths and Bonds of Allegiance Men had entered into. 3. In juſtifying Rebellion on the account of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. As to the firſt, The ſetting up a Court of Judicature over Sovereign Princes. The Jeſuit, <hi>he obſerves,</hi> had endeavoured to come off by the idle diſtinction of a <hi>direct</hi> and <hi>indirect</hi> Power. And the Commonwealthſmen (ſays he) do herein agree with them: For they do not ſay that the People have a direct power over their Prince, (which were a contradiction in its ſelf, for Subjects to command their Sovereigns,) but only breach of Truſt, the <hi>People</hi> have an <hi>indirect Power</hi> to call their Princes to an account, and to deprive them of their Authority.
<note place="margin">Pag. 5.</note> — The main thing to be debated is (ſays he) whether Sovereign Princes have a Supreme and Independent Authority inherent in their Perſons or no: or whether they are to be accountable to others. That upon Male-Adminiſtration they may be deprived of their Government. This is the firſt and chief Point, and the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licans, and Aſſerters of the Pope's Depoſing Power, are perfectly agreed in the Affirmative of the latter Queſtion, and only differ as to the Perſons in whom the Power of calling Princes to an account doth lie; whether in the Pope or in the People.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>And even as to this, they do not differ ſo much as Men may at firſt imagin. For however the <hi>Primitive Chriſtians</hi> thought it no flattery to Princes, to derive their Power immediately from God, and to make them accountable to him alone, as being Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior to all below him, (as might be eaſily proved by multitudes of Teſtimonies:) Yet after the Popes Depoſing Power came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to requeſt, the Commonwealth Principles did ſo too; and the
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:64059:173" rendition="simple:additions"/>Power of Princes was ſaid to be of another Original, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were accountable to the People.</q> And having ſhown the Affinity of ſuch Doctrines and Principles in both, by ſome Tragical effects of them, as well at home as abroad, he proceeds thus.
<note place="margin">Pag. 12.</note> — <q>If we enquire farther into the Reaſons of theſe Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, we ſhall find them alike on both ſides The Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealthſmen, when they are asked how the People having once parted with their Power, come to reſume it: They preſently run to <hi>an implicit Contract between the Prince and the People,</hi> by vertue whereof the People have a Fundamental Power left in themſelves, which they are not to exerciſe, but upon Princes violating the Truſt committed to them. The very ſame Ground is made the <hi>Foundation</hi> of the <hi>Popes Depoſing Power,</hi> viz. An <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit Contract,</hi> that all Princes made when they were Chriſtians, to ſubmit their Scepters to the Popes Authority, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>And where he reaſons againſt theſe Principles from the Doctrine of Chriſt and his Apoſtles.
<note place="margin">Pag. 15.</note> 
                     <q>The Religion they taught (ſays he) never meddled with Crowns and Scepters, but left to <hi>Ceſar</hi> the things that were <hi>Ceſar</hi>'s, and never gave the leaſt intimation to Princes of any Forfeiture of their Authority, if they did not <hi>render to God the things that are God's.</hi>
                     </q> Concluding that Head with this Reflection upon the whole. <q>In my <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </p>
                  <p>But then ſecondly, as to the breaking of Oaths and Bonds of Allegiance; he firſt lays down, <q>That the Duty betwixt Princes and Subjects is natural and antecedent to their embracing the Chriſtian Religion. And therefore ſecondly, the abſolving Subjects from that, is in plain terms nulling the Obligation to a natural Duty, and taking away the Force of Oaths and Promiſes. And thirdly, That all Mankind are agreed, that it is a ſin to break a lawful Oath, and the more ſolemn and weighty the Oath is, the greater is the Perjury.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>And then proceeds to ſhew, that the Power which abſolves from ſuch Oaths is a Power of turning Evil into Good, and Good into Evil, of making civil Obedience to Princes to be a Crime, and Perjury to be none, and ſuch as from the Schoolmen he proves to be greater than they allow of in <hi>God himſelf,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pag. 18.</note> where there is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſick Goodneſs in the Nature of the thing, and inſeparable Evil from the contrary to it, As in the Caſe (ſays he) of Diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence

<note place="margin">Pag. 24.</note> and evil good, when it ſerves their turn.</hi> For this is plainly ſetting up a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Intereſt under the Name of the Good of the Church, and violating the Laws of Righteouſneſs to advance it. If Men break through Oaths and the moſt ſolemn Engagements and Promiſes, and regard no Bonds of Juſtice and Honeſty to compaſs their Ends, let them call them by what ſpecious Names they pleaſe, <hi>The Good Old Cauſe,</hi> or <hi>The Good of the Church,</hi> (it matters not which) there can be no greater ſign of Hypocriſie and real Wickedneſs than this, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And laſtly, as for the juſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Rebellion upon the account of Religion, having cited the

                     <hi>I have often heretofore wondred at the aſſurance of the</hi> Romiſh <hi>Authors, who wrote againſt our Church a little after the Reformation, that they could ſo confidently accuſe the whole Body of Preteſtants, as the Preachers, and Practiſers of Rebellion;</hi> (<hi>for ſo ſays</hi> Stapleton

But whomſoever this accuſation might concern in thoſe days, I am ſure, it did not touch the</hi> Church of England, <hi>of whoſe Loyalty her adverſary</hi> Chriſtopher Goodman <hi>gives a fair teſtimony,

                     <hi>And tho it may be expected, that every Age will produce ſuch</hi> Boutefeau<hi>'s, yet the Doctrin of the Croſs, and the benefits of a patient ſuffering of injuries will, I hope, be always ſo well underſtood in the World, that all the attempts of the</hi> Jeſuits, <hi>and their Journeymen (for it is from their ſhop that theſe Wares come) will prove vain, and the true Catholick Doctrin of</hi> Paſſive Obedience <hi>will be ſtill owned, ſtill honored, and when God calls to the performance of is practiſed; — the Chriſtian Religion is ſoft and gentle, its Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was laid in the blood of its inſtitutor, and our Holy Saviour, the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructure

                     <hi>How truly Ancient, and Primitive the Doctrin of</hi> Paſſive Obedience <hi>is, comes not within the limits of this preſent Hiſtory, but may be hereafter conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, by deducing it through the Writings and Practices of the earlieſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians down to the days of King</hi> Henry VIII. <hi>But thoſe times in the eſteem of</hi> John Goodwin <hi>were times of ignorance, and the truth was but in its dawn, and by a glimmering light Men were eaſily led out of their way; for he ſays, that the Primitive Chriſtians (and among them he muſt include the Apoſtles,
<note place="margin">Anti-Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valeriſm.

                     <note place="margin">Defenſ. pro pop.

                     <hi>Thus in the Opinion of ſuch Writers,</hi> Paſſive Obedience <hi>was the weakneſs of the Ancient Chriſtians, and a ſign, they were under a lower diſpenſation, and that to aſſert it neceſſary in this more inlightned Age is to contradict the moſt eminent Reformers, and the Fundamental Liberties of Nature; and if after all this ſome Men ſhould be ſo reſty, as to quote St.</hi> Paul <hi>to the</hi> Romans <hi>for their ſubmiſſion to Princes,</hi>

                        <p>For when <hi>Bonner</hi> was for his prevarication ſuſpected, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of, and convened before the King's Council, among other <hi>Injunctions</hi> then given him, one was, that <hi>he ſhould perſonally preach
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:64059:7"/>within three weeks after at</hi> Paul's Croſs. And among the <hi>ſpecial points and Articles that were to be treated of by him in his Sermon,</hi> this was the firſt.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. <hi>That all ſuch, as rebel againſt their Prince, get unto them damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and thoſe that reſiſt the higher Powers, reſiſt the Ordinance of God; and he that dieth therefore in Rebellion, by the word of God is utterly damned, and ſo loſeth both body and ſoul; and therefore thoſe Rebels in</hi> Devon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire <hi>and</hi> Cornwal, <hi>in</hi> Norfolk, <hi>or elſewhere, who take upon them to aſſemble a Power and Force againſt their King, and Prince, againſt the Laws and Statutes of the Realm, and go about to ſubvert the State, and Order of the Commonwealth, not only to deſerve therefore death, as Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors and Rebels, but do accumulate to themſelves eternal damnation, even to be in the burning Fire of Hell with</hi> Lucifer, <hi>the Father, and firſt Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of Pride, Diſobedience and Rebellion, what pretence ſoever they have, — as</hi> Corah, Dathan <hi>and</hi> Abirom <hi>for Rebellion againſt</hi> Moſes <hi>were ſwallowed down alive into Hell, altho they pretended to ſacrifice unto God. And</hi> 4. <hi>That our Authority of Royal Power is (as of truth it is) of no leſs authority and force in this our young Age, than is, or was of any of our Predeceſſors, tho the ſame were much elder; as may appear by example of</hi> Joſias, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> How <hi>Bonner</hi> diſcharged his Obedience to theſe <hi>Injunctions,</hi> is not my preſent Province, the <hi>Martyrology</hi> will inform the Reader: but what is already related undeniably proves what was the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England</hi> in thoſe Days.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anno</hi> 1541. was Dr. <hi>Robert Barnes</hi> martyred,
<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Vide</hi> his Life pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed to his Works.</note> and at the ſtake he profeſſed; <q>That he never to his knowledge taught any erroneous Doctrine, but only thoſe things which the Scripture led him unto; and that in his Sermons he never maintain'd any Error, nor gave occaſion of any Inſurrection, — but with all diligence did ſtudy evermore to ſet forth the Glory of God, the Obedience to our So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign Lord the King, and the true and ſincere Religion of Chriſt — deſiring the People to bear witneſs, that he deteſted and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred all evil Opinions, and Doctrines againſt the Word of God.</q>— And his Writings are agreeable to his dying Proteſtation. <hi>In his Supplication to King</hi> Henry <hi>the Eighth,</hi> when condemned to die, treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Cruelties of the Popiſh Clergy, among other things, he ſays, <q>If they cannot make a Man a Heretick,
<note place="margin">P. 183.</note> to colour and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain their Oppreſſion, they add Treaſon againſt your Grace, tho he be never ſo true a Subject, and all unlikely to make any reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, or to think any evil unto your Grace.
<note place="margin">P. 184.</note>— Whereas it is they that go about to make Inſurrection to the maintaining of their worldly pomp and pride, and not the true Preacher — Who is he
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:64059:8"/>that would be a Traitor, or maintain a Traitor againſt your moſt excellent and noble Grace? I think, no Man; yea, and I know ſurely, that no Man can do it without the great diſpleaſure of the eternal God. For S. <hi>Paul</hi> commandeth ſtraitly unto all Chriſtians to be obedient in all things,
<note place="margin">Rom. 13.</note> on this manner; <hi>Let every man ſubmit himſelf to the authority of the higher power, for whoſoever reſiſteth the power, reſiſteth the ordinance of God; and they that reſiſt ſhall receive to themſelves damnation.</hi>
                              <note place="margin">1 Pet. 2.</note> Alſo S. <hi>Peter</hi> confirmeth this ſaying, <hi>Submit your ſelves unto all manner of ordinance of man,</hi> &amp;c. Wherefore, if every man had the Scriptures (as I would to God they had) to judge every Man's Doctrine,
<note place="margin">☞</note> then were it out of queſtion, that the Preachers thereof either would, or could make, or cauſe to be made any Inſurrection againſt their Prince, ſeeing the ſelf ſame Scripture ſtraitly commandeth all Subjects to be obedient unto their Princes, as <hi>Paul</hi> witneſſeth, ſaying, <hi>Warn them,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that they ſubmit themſelves to princes, and to powers, and to obey the officers.</hi>
                           </q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <q>Now how can they that preach, and exhort all Men to this Doctrine, cauſe any Inſurrection, or Diſobedience againſt their Prince. — Call to mind the old Prophets, and with a ſingle eye judge, if any of them either privily, or apertly ſtirred up the People againſt their Princes.
<note place="margin">P. 185.</note> Look on Chriſt, if he ſubmitted not himſelf to the high powers; paid he not Tribute, for all he was free, and cauſed <hi>Peter</hi> likewiſe to pay? Suffered not he with all patience the puniſhments of the Princes? Yea, Death moſt cruel, altho they did him open wrong, and could find him guilty in no Cauſe. Look alſo on the Apoſtles—and if ever they ſtirred, by any occaſion, the People againſt their Princes; yea, if they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves obeyed not to all Princes, altho the moſt part of them were Tyrants and Infidels. Conſider likewiſe thoſe Doctors, which purely and ſincerely have handled the Word of God, either in Preaching or Writing; if ever by their means any Inſurrection, or Diſobedience riſe among the People againſt their Princes: but you ſhall rather find, that they have been rather ready to lay down their own Heads, to ſuffer with all patience whatſoever Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny any Power would miniſter unto them, giving all People example to do the ſame.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <q>Now to conclude, if neither the Scripture, neither the Practice of the Preachers thereof teacheth, nor affirmeth, that the People may diſobey their Princes, or their Ordinances, but contrariwiſe teacheth all Obedience to be done unto them, it is plain, that
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:64059:8"/>thoſe Biſhops, or rather Papiſts do falſly accuſe thoſe true Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and Subjects: which thing would appear in every Man's ſight, if by their violence the Word of God were not kept under.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <q>Now is this the Doctrin, that I do Preach and Teach,
<note place="margin">☜</note> and none other as concerning this matter, God I take to record, and all my Books and Writings, that ever I wrote or made; and only I allow and favor them, which further this Doctrine of Chriſt; and of this I am ſure, mine Adverſaries, or rather Adverſaries to Chriſt's Doctrin muſt bear me witneſs. After this he proceeds to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, that the Pope and the Papiſtical Biſhops are they, who Preach to the People the contrary Doctrin; as that St. <hi>Peter</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empts himſelf, and his Succeſſors from being ſubject to Superiors, that Subjects may be diſobedient to their own Lords, and that the Pope may Depoſe Kings, that he hath autority to break all Oaths, Bonds, and Obligations; and other ſuch like poſitions, and then adds, — there is no Officer, that hath need to be afraid of Chriſt's Goſpel, nor yet of the Preachers thereof;
<note place="margin">☜</note> but of thoſe privy Traitors can no Man be too wary, — the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture commandeth us to obey to wicked Princes, and giveth us none autority to Depoſe them, — who was more wicked than <hi>Herod?</hi> and yet St. <hi>John</hi> ſuffer'd Death under him: Who was wickeder than Pilate? and yet Chriſt did not put him down, but was Crucified under him. Briefly, which of all the Princes were good in the Apoſtles days? and yet they depoſed none: So that God's word, and their own learning, and the Practice of our Maſter Chriſt, and his Holy Apoſtles are openly againſt them;
<note place="margin">p. 190.</note> there is no People under Heaven, that more abhors, and with earneſter heart reſiſteth, and more diligently doth Preach againſt Diſobedience than we do: Yea, I dare ſay boldly, let all your Books be ſearch'd that were written this 500 Years; and all they ſhall not declare the autority of a Prince, and the true obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence toward him,</q> as one of our little Books ſhall do, that be condemn'd by you for Hereſie.
<note place="margin">p. 202. 204.</note> And then he impeacheth them of denying, that the King's Power is immediatly of God; while it can never be proved, that ever we ſpake againſt God, or our King.</p>
                        <p>The ſame Learned and Holy Martyr in his Diſcourſe, that <hi>Mens Conſtitutions not grounded in Scripture, bind not the Conſcience,</hi> is of the ſame mind. — <q>If the power command any thing of Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny againſt Right, and Law, (always provided that it repugn not againſt the Goſpel,
<note place="margin">p. 292. 293. 294.</note> nor deſtroy our Faith) our Charity muſt needs ſuffer it; for as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Charity ſuffereth all things:</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:64059:9"/>our Maſter Chriſt, <hi>If a man ſtrike thee on the one Cheek, turn him the other:</hi> For if he doth exerciſe Tyranny, if he command thee any thing againſt right, or do thee any wrong, (as for an example, caſt thee in Priſon wrongfully) if thou canſt by any reaſonable and quiet means without Sedition, Inſurrection, or breaking of the common Peace ſave thy ſelf, or avoid his Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny, thou may'ſt do it with a good Conſcience, — but in no wiſe,
<note place="margin">☞</note> be it right or wrong, may'ſt thou make any reſiſtance with a Sword or with Hand; but obey, except thou canſt avoid as I have ſhewed thee; but if the Cauſe be right, lawful, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to the Common-wealth; thou muſt obey, and thou muſt not ſly without ſin. — But ſuppoſe the King ſhould condemn the New Teſtament in <hi>England;</hi> and command, that none of his Subjects ſhould have it; is he to be obeyed or not? — this will be a great Scourge, and an intolerable plague. — My Lords, the Popiſh Biſhops, would depoſe him with ſhort deliberation, and make no Conſcience of it; they have Depoſed Princes for leſſer Cauſes than this is a great deal. But againſt them will I always lay Chriſt's Fact, and his Holy Apoſtles, and the Word of God. If the King forbid the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> &amp;c. under a temporal pain, or elſe under the pain of Death; Men ſhall firſt make faithful Prayers to God, and then diligent Interceſſion unto the King's Grace with all due Subjection, that his Grace would releaſe that commandment; if he will not do it, they ſhall keep their <hi>Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> with all other Ordinances of Chriſt, and let the King exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe his Tyranny (if they cannot fly) and in no wiſe under the pain of Damnation ſhall they withſtand him with violence, but ſuffer patiently all the Tyranny, that he layeth on them both in their bodies and goods; and leave the vengeance of it unto their Heavenly Father: — But in no wiſe ſhall they reſiſt violently, neither ſhall they deny Chriſt's verity, nor yet forſake it before the Prince; — neither ſhall they go about to Depoſe their Prince,
<note place="margin">p. 295.</note> as my Lords the Biſhops were wont to do; but they ſhall boldly confeſs, that they have the verity, and will thereby abide.</q> And this he proves by the examples of <hi>Peter,</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> and of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> of the <hi>three Children,</hi> and <hi>Daniel,</hi> and then adds; <q>ſo that Chriſtian Men are bound to obey in ſuffering the King's Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, but not in conſenting to his unlawful commandment; always having before their eyes the comfortable ſaying of Chriſt, <hi>Fear not them that can kill the body, which when they have done, they can no more do,</hi> &amp;c.</q>

                        <p>In this Book the Expoſition of the Fifth Commandment teacheth us thus: <q>In this Commandment, by theſe words <hi>Father</hi> and <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> is underſtood not only the natural Father and Mother, which did carnally beget us, and brought us up, but alſo Princes, and all other Governors, Rulers and Paſtors, under whom we be nouriſhed, brought up, ordered and guided.</q> And by this word
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:64059:10"/>
                           <hi>Honor,</hi> in this Commandment is not only meant a Reverence, and <q>lowlineſs in words and outward geſture—but alſo a prompt and ready obedience to their lawful Commandments, a regard to their Words, a forbearing and ſuffering of them, an inward love and veneration towards them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> this is the very Honor and Duty, which not only the Children do owe unto their Parents, but alſo all Subjects and Inferiors to their Heads and Rulers.</q>— And after this having fully ſhewn the Duties of Children to their Parents, and Parents to their Children, from the Precepts and Examples of holy Scripture, it proceeds — <q>This Commandment alſo containeth the Honor and Obedience which Subjects owe unto their Princes; for Scripture taketh Princes to be as it were Fathers and Nurſes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their Subjects.</q> Then reckoning up the ſeveral Duties of Princes, it adds — <q>And all their Subjects muſt again on their parts, and be bound by this Commandment, not only to honor and obey the ſaid Princes, according as Subjects be bound to do; and to owe their truth and fidelity unto them, as unto their natural Lords, but they muſt alſo love them, as Children do love their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; yea, they muſt more tender the Surety of their Prince's Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and his Eſtate, than their own, or any others, even like as the Health of the Head is more to be tendered than the Health of any other Member. And by this Commandment alſo Subjects be bound not to withdraw their ſaid Fealty, Truth, Love and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence toward their Princes <hi>for any cauſe,
<note place="margin">☞</note> whatſoever it be;</hi> ne <hi>in any cauſe</hi> may they conſpire againſt his perſon, ne do any thing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the hinderance, or hurt thereof, nor of his Eſtate. And furthermore by this Commandment they be bound to obey alſo all the Laws, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> made by their Princes and Governors, except they be againſt the Commandment of God. — They muſt alſo give unto their Prince aid,
<note place="margin">☞</note> help and aſſiſtance, whenſoever he ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the ſame, either for ſurety, preſervation, or maintenance of his Perſon and Eſtate, or of the Realm.— And further, if any Subject ſhall know of any thing, which is, or may be to the noy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, or damage of his Prince's Perſon, or Eſtate; he is bound by this Commandment to diſcloſe the ſame with all ſpeed to the Prince himſelf, or to ſome of his Council; for it is the very Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that every Member ſhould employ himſelf to preſerve an defend the Head. — And that all Subjects do owe unto their Princes and Governors ſuch Honor and Obedience, as is aforeſaid, it appeareth evidently in ſundry places of Scripture, but eſpecially in the Epiſtle of S. <hi>Paul (Rom.</hi> 13.) and S. <hi>Peter</hi> (1 Pet. 2.) and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:64059:10"/>there be many Examples in Scripture of the great Vengeance of God, that hath fallen upon ſuch as have been diſobedient unto their Princes; But one principal Example to be noted, is of the Rebellion, which <hi>Chore, Dathan,</hi> and <hi>Abiron</hi> made againſt their Governors <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron:</hi> For puniſhment of which Rebels, God not only cauſed the Earth to open, and to ſwallow them down,—but cauſed alſo the Fire to deſcend from Heaven, and to burn up 250 Captains, which conſpired with them in the ſame Rebellion.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>And the Explanation of the Sixth Commandment ſaith thus;
<note place="margin">☜</note> 
                           <q>Moreover no Subjects may draw their Swords againſt their Prince <hi>for any Cauſe whatſoever it be;</hi> nor againſt any other (ſaving for lawful defence) without their Prince's licence; and it is their Duty to draw their Swords in defence of their Prince and Realm, whenſoever the Prince ſhall command them ſo to do. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though Princes, which be the Chief and Supreme Heads of their Realms, do otherwiſe than they ought to do,
<note place="margin">☜</note> yet God hath aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned no Judges over them in this World, but will have the Judgment of them reſerved to himſelf, and will puniſh them when he ſeeth his time, and for amendment of ſuch Princes that do otherwiſe than they ſhould do, the Subjects may not rebel, but muſt pray to God, which hath the Hearts of Princes in his Hands, that he ſo turn their Hearts to him, that they may uſe the Sword, which he hath given them, unto his pleaſure.</q>

                           <q>I have made this little Treatiſe that followeth, containing all Obedience that is of God.—Now (as ever) the moſt part ſeek Liberty; they be glad, when they hear the unſatiable Covetouſneſs of the Spirituality rebuked; — When Tyranny and and Oppreſſion is preach'd againſt: — And therefore, becauſe the Heads will not ſo rule, will they alſo no longer obey, but reſiſt and riſe againſt their evil Heads? And one wicked deſtroyeth another; yet is God's Word not the cauſe of this, neither yet the Preachers; for tho that Chriſt himſelf taught all Obedience, how that it is not lawful to reſiſt wrong (but for the Officer that is appointed thereto), and how a Man muſt love his Enemy, and pray for them that perſecute him,—and how that all Vengeance muſt be remitted to God;—Yet the People, for the moſt part, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it not,
<note place="margin">☞</note> they were ever ready to riſe and to fight.—Thus ſeeſt thou, that it is the bloody Doctrine of the Pope that cauſeth Diſobedience, Rebellion, and Inſurrection; for he teacheth to fight and to defend his Traditions,—and to diſobey Father, Mother, Maſter, Lord, King, and Emperor,—where the peaceable Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Chriſt teacheth to obey, and to ſuffer for the Word of God, and to remit the Vengeance, and defence of the Word to God, which is mighty and able to defend it.</q>

Verily for it was not lawful; for if he had done it, he muſt have ſinned againſt God; for God hath made the King in every Realm Judg over all, and over him is there no Judg: He that judgeth the King, judgeth God, and he that layeth hands on the King, layeth hands on God, and he that reſiſteth the King, reſiſteth God, and damneth God's Laws and Ordinance.

                        <p>This Reverend Martyr on verſe the firſt ſaith, <q>that St. <hi>Paul</hi> pronounceth generally, that <hi>every Soul,</hi> i. e. every Man, ſhould be obedient unto the higher power, — of what condition, ſtate, and degree ſoever, he be — to the powers St. <hi>Paul</hi> command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth obedience, honour, reverence, and love to be born; and this is eſpecially to be noted in St. <hi>Paul,</hi> that he ſays ſimply and plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, we ſhould obey the higher powers, to confute, argue, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend thoſe, that cloak and excuſe their inobedience, either for the age of the Rulers, or elſe for the conditions and manners of the Rulers: — the manners and conditions of the Magiſtrates do not excuſe our inobedience, tho they be naught; for <hi>Paul</hi> bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth us to look upon the Power and Authority of the Higher Powers,
<note place="margin">1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.</note> and not upon their Manners; and St. <hi>Peter</hi> commandeth the Servants to obey their Maſters, tho they be evil; ſo <hi>Joſeph</hi> obeyed <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi> our Saviour <hi>Pilate,</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors of <hi>Rome, Caligula</hi> and <hi>Nero;</hi> and when St. <hi>Paul</hi> command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:64059:14"/>us to be obedient, he meaneth, not only we ſhould ſpeak re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verently and honorably of the Higher Power, — but to obey the Laws ſet forth by the Power, except they command things againſt God's Laws; then muſt we obey more God than Men;
<note place="margin">☜</note> and yet not to ſtrive and fight with the Magiſtrates, but ſuffer patiently death, rather than to offend God, or elſe our obedience is nothing but hypocriſie and diſſimulation. Who would accept his own Child's making of Courteſie, when all his facts be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to his commandment? What Maſler would be content, or think his Servant doth his duty in putting off his cap, and in his doing contemneth all his Maſter's Laws and Commandments? the Laws of a Magiſtrate, if they be repugnant to the Word of God, they ſhould not be obeyed; yet rather ſhould a Man ſuffer death, than to defend himſelf by force,
<note place="margin">☜</note> and violent reſiſting of the Superior Powers; as Chriſt, his Apoſtles, and the Prophets did.</q>

                           <p>On verſe 2. Becauſe that naturally there is in every Man a certain deſire of liberty, and to live without ſubjection and all manner of Laws, except ſuch as pleaſe himſelf, St. <hi>Paul</hi> is not content generally to exhort, and command all Men to obedience of the Higher Powers, but giveth many great and weighty cauſes, wherefore Men ſhould be obedient, and in ſubjection to them. The firſt is, becauſe the Office of a Magiſtrate is <hi>the Ordinance of God,</hi> — and therefore the Magiſtrate muſt be obeyed, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept we will ſay, in ſome reſpects God is not to be obeyed; — therefore the Magiſtrates be called <hi>Gods</hi> in Scripture: — un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly Princes God ſuffers, and appoints for the ſins of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; but let the King and Magiſtrate be as wicked as can be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed and thought,
<note place="margin">☜</note> yet is his place and office the Ordinance and Appointment of God, and therefore to be obeyed. — and in caſe they do any thing in their Offices contrary to the Word of God, although the Subjects may not, nor upon pain of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Damnation, ought not by force nor violence to reſiſt the Officer in his High Power; yet they are bound to think, that God can, and will as well revenge the abuſe of his Office in them, as puniſh the Subject for the diſobedience of his ordinance towards the Higher Power. If it be true, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>the higher power to be the Ordinance of God,</hi> it is very damnable iniquity, that for any private affection, or other unjuſt oppreſſions, for any Man to depoſe the Magiſtrates from their Places and Honors appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by God; or elſe privily, or openly, craftily or violently to go
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:64059:15"/>about to change, or alter the State and Ordinance of God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The ſecond cauſe is, the great peril and danger it is to reſiſt and diſobey God's Ordinances; <hi>They that reſiſt, ſhall receive to themſelves damnation;</hi> as tho he had ſaid, leſt ye ſhould think it a light thing, but a trifling matter to withſtand, and diſobey the Magiſtrates; underſtand ye, that in ſo doing ye ſtand and fight againſt God, and therefore ye provoke Judgment and Vengeance againſt your ſelves, and be culpable and guilty of God's everlaſting diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, if ye repent not. Here St. <hi>Paul</hi> hath ſet forth the End, and ſucceſs of Sedition,
<note place="margin">☞</note> Treaſon, Conſpiracy, and Rebellion; that is to ſay, deſtruction both of Body and Soul; and who is able to contend and fight with God?</p>
                           <p>On verſe 5. One cauſe, wherefore we muſt obey, is the fear of pain and puniſhment, which the Magiſtrate muſt miniſter by the commandment of God, unto all ſuch as diſobey and contemn the Ordinance of God: the other is conſcience; for although the Magiſtrate do not ſee nor know, how thou doſt diſobey and break the Order of God; or elſe, if thou could'ſt by power and ſtrength overcome the Magiſtrates, yet thy conſcience is bound to obey,—there be ſome ſo indurate and paſt grace, that think themſelves not bound to obey this order, and Higher Power appointed and commanded of God; but doubtleſs thoſe ſhall periſh with their Captains, as <hi>Achitophel</hi> did with his <hi>Abſalom;</hi> if the Higher Power command any thing contrary to God's Word, they ſhould not be obey'd; notwithſtanding there ſhould be ſuch modeſty and ſoberneſs uſed, as ſhould be without all violence, force, rebellion, as <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> uſed,
<note place="margin">☞</note> ſaying. <hi>God is more to be obeyed than Man;</hi> and ſo in ſaying of truth, they continued in the truth, without moving of Sedition, and ſuffered death for the truth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

<pb n="21" facs="tcp:64059:15"/>thereof unto him, who can, and will ſo moderate all afflictions, that no man ſhall have more laid upon him, than in Chriſt he ſhall be able to bear; — theſe days be dangerous and full of peril,
<note place="margin">p. 136.</note> but yet let us comfort our ſelves in calling to remembrance the days of our forefathers, upon whom the Lord ſent ſuch troubles, that many hundreds, yea many thouſands died for the teſtimony of</hi> Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>both men and women, ſuffering with patience and conſtancy, as much cruelty as Tyrants could deviſe, and ſo departed out of this miſerable World to the Bliſs everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting.
<note place="margin">p. 139.</note> — Who would not now rather than to offend ſo merciful a God, fly this wicked Realm, as your moſt Chriſtian Brother, and many other have done; or elſe with boldneſs of heart, and patience of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit bear manfully the Croſs, even unto the death? — Albeit I know,
<note place="margin">p. 141/2</note> that all thoſe which ſeek God's honour, and the furtherance of his Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel be accounted the Queens Enemies, altho we daily pray for her Grace, and never think her harm; but we muſt be content to ſuffer ſlander, and patiently to bear all ſuch injuries. Nevertheleſs this is out of doubt, that the Queens Highneſs hath no authority to compel any man to believe any thing contrary to God's word; neither may the Subject give her Grace that Obedience; in caſe he do, his Soul is loſt for ever. Our bodies,
<note place="margin">☜</note> goods, and lives be at her Highneſs commandment, and ſhe ſhall have them, as of true Subjects; but the Soul of man for Religion is bound to none, but unto God and his holy Word.
<note place="margin">p. 148, 149</note> — Seeing therefore we live for this life among ſo many, and great perils and dangers, we muſt be well aſſured by God's word how to bear them, and how patiently to take them, as they be ſent to us from God; we muſt alſo aſſure our ſelves, that there is no other remedy for Chriſtians in the time of trouble, than Chriſt himſelf hath appointed us. In St.</hi> Luke <hi>he giveth us this commandment,</hi> ye ſhall poſſeſs your lives in patience, <hi>ſaith he; in the which words he giveth us both commandment, what to do, and alſo great conſolation and comfort in all troubles; he ſheweth alſo what is to be done, and what is to be hoped for in troubles; and when troubles happen, he biddeth us be patient, and</hi> in no caſe <hi>violently,
<note place="margin">☜</note> nor ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly to reſiſt our perſecutors, becauſe God hath ſuch care and charge of us, that he will keep in the midſt of all troubles the very hairs of our heads, ſo that not one of them ſhall fall away without the will, and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of our Heavenly Father. — Wherefore the Chriſtian Man's Faith muſt be always upon the Reſurrection of Chriſt,
<note place="margin">p. 150.</note> when he is in trouble; and in that glorious Reſurrection he ſhall not only ſee continual and perpetual joy and conſolation, but alſo the victory and triumph of all perſecution, trouble, ſin, death, hell,</hi> &amp;c. — <hi>the pains alſo they vex us withal for the time, if they tarry with us as long as we live;
<note place="margin">p. 153.</note>
                              <pb n="22" facs="tcp:64059:16"/>yet, when death cometh, they ſhall avoid and give place to ſuch joys, as be prepared for us in Chriſt; for no pains of the World be perpetual, and whether they ſhall afflict us for all the time of our mortal life, we know not; for they be the Servants of God to go, and to come as he commandeth them. But we muſt take heed, we meddle not forcibly, nor ſeditiouſly to put away the perſecution appointed unto us by God;
<note place="margin">☞</note> but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member Chriſt's ſaying,</hi> poſſeſs your lives by your patience; <hi>and in this commandment God requireth in every Man and Woman this patient obedience.

                        <p>It is alſo remarkable, that at that time the Proteſtants were no contemptible party of Men in the Nation, that Queen <hi>Mary</hi> had been diſinherited by <hi>Act of Parliament</hi> (<hi>a Bill of Excluſion</hi> paſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the formality of a Law) and that for illegitimacy, as it is their

<note place="margin">☜</note> God he knoweth, I never liked, nor never any thing grieved me ſo much, as that your Grace's Brother did; and if by any means it had been in me to have letted the making of that Will, I would have done it; and what I ſaid therein, as well to his Council, as to himſelf, divers of your Majeſties Council can report, but none ſo well as the Marqueſs of <hi>Northampton,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Darcy</hi>—which two were then preſent at the Communication between the King's Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty and me. I deſired to talk with the King's Majeſty alone, but I could not be ſuffered, and ſo I failed of my purpoſe; for if I might have communed with the King alone, and at good leiſure, my truſt was, that I ſhould have altered him from that purpoſe; but they being preſent, my labor was in vain. Then, when I could not diſſuade him from the ſaid Will, and both he and his Privy Council alſo informed me, that the Judges, and his Learned Council, ſaid, That the Act of entailing the Crown, made by his Father, could not be prejudicial to him, but that he being in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of the Crown might make his Will thereof; this ſeemed very ſtrange to me; but being the Sentence of the Judges, and other his Learned Council in the Laws of this Realm (as both he and his Council informed me) methought it became not me, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unlearned to the Law, to ſtand againſt my Prince therein; and ſo at length I was required by the King's Majeſty himſelf to ſet my hand to his Will, ſaying, that he truſted, that I alone would not be more repugnant to his Will, than the reſt of the Council were (which words ſurely grieved my heart very ſore) and ſo I granted him to ſubſcribe his Will, and to follow the ſame; which, when I had ſet my hand unto, I did it unfeignedly, and without diſſimulation: for the which I ſubmit my ſelf moſt humbly unto your Majeſty,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:64059:19"/>acknowledging mine Offence with moſt grievous and ſorrowful Heart, and beſeeching your mercy and pardon; which, my Heart giveth me, ſhall not be denied unto me, being granted before to ſo many, which travelled not ſo much to diſſuade both the King and his Council, as I did. And whereas it is containad in two Acts of Parliament, as I underſtand, that I with the Duke of <hi>Northumberland</hi> ſhould deviſe, and compaſs the Deprivation of your Majeſty from your Royal Crown, ſurely it is untrue; for the Duke never opened his mouth unto me to move me any ſuch matter, nor I him; nor his Heart was not ſuch towards me (ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing long time my Deſtruction) that he would either truſt me in ſuch a matter, or think that I would be perſuaded by him. It was other of the Council that moved me, and the King himſelf, the Duke of <hi>Northumberland</hi> not being preſent. Neither before, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther after had I any privy communication with the Duke about that matter, ſaving, that openly, at the Council Table, the Duke ſaid unto me, that it became not me to ſay to the King, as I did, when I went about to diſſuade him from the ſaid Will.</p>
                              <p>Now as concerning the State of Religion, as it is uſed in this Realm of <hi>England</hi> at this preſent; if it pleaſe your Higneſs to li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe me, I would gladly write my mind unto your Majeſty. I will never,

                           <hi>John Young,</hi> Doctor of Divinity, preach'd before the Queen, the Second of <hi>March,</hi> 1575. on <hi>Pſal.</hi> 131. <hi>Lord, I am not high minded,</hi> and he tells us, the occaſion of writing the Pſalm was, <hi>That there were certain Paraſites and Flatterers attending upon King</hi> Saul; <hi>who, maligning</hi> David, <hi>becauſe that by Almighty God's ſpecial appointment he was anointed King over</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and ſeeking to bring him into diſcredit, and into hatred with his Prince, did inſinuate, that he did ſecretly practiſe the Depoſing him from the Kingdom, and the Advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of himſelf ambitiouſly to the ſame: Therefore the Prophet declares their Suggeſtions to be moſt falſe and ſlanderous, and himſelf to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent from that great Offence.</hi>—S. Auſtin <hi>ſaith, He that will go about to ſatifie and fulfil (as all other) ſo that ambitious and arrogant deſire, ſhall find it a Toyl of all Toyls, ſuch a Labor, as</hi> Samſon <hi>or</hi> Hercules, <hi>never atchiev'd.—This deſire of Honor, Rule, Principality, worldly Glory, and Renown, is in the Heart of Man (if it be once poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed therewithal) a Worm that dyeth not,</hi> &amp;c.—<hi>Now</hi> David, <hi>when he ſaith,</hi> He did not exerciſe himſelf in ſuch great matters, <hi>&amp;c.
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:64059:30"/>his meaning was, that he did never ſeek (as he was moſt falſly and unjuſtly charged by ſome) to advance himſelf ambitiouſly to the Kingdom, King</hi> Saul, <hi>his Maſter, being alive; becauſe he knew well enough, that it was too great for him to wield, and too high alſo for him to aſpire unto.—Such was the Humility of this excellent Man, the Friend of God, to the utter Condemnation and Confuſion of all thoſe, whoſe whole ſtudy and endeavour evermore hath been, and is at this day, to undermine thoſe which be in authority, to invade and occupy other mens Kingdoms, to wring the Scepter and Sword out of Princes hands. — This is a Vice never enough to be deteſted, conſidering the manifold and great Miſchiefs which have come thereby to Heaven, to Earth, to Angels, to Men, to all Kingdoms and Commonwealths, to the whole World.—This ambitious Man is a Thief, is a Homicide, if it lye in his power, he is a Regicide, he is the Parricide of his Countrey.—I will only put you in mind of one only Leſſon, which we are taught by this Verſe, which is this, that it is much better for us</hi> ſperare, quàm aſpirare, <hi>to truſt in Almighty God, than to aſpire; for in aſpiring there be many Inconveniences,—but the anchor-hold of Hope is firm and ſure,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                        <p>They poſitively aſſert; <hi>that God having created our firſt Parents, and purpoſing to multiply their ſeed into many Generations, for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleniſhing of the World with their Poſterity, did give to</hi> Adam <hi>for his time, and to the reſt of the Patriarchs, and chief Fathers ſucceſſively be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Flood, Authority, Power, and Dominion over their Children, and Offſpring to Rule, and Govern them; — adding further,
<note place="margin">Can. 2.</note> if any Man ſhall affirm, that Men at the firſt without all good Edacation or civility ran up and down in Woods and Fields, as wild creatures, reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves in Caves and Dens, and acknowledging no Superiority one over another, until they were taught by experience the neceſſity of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and that thereupon, they choſe ſome among themſelves to order and rule the reſt, giving them power and authority ſo to do; and that conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently all civil Power, Juriſdiction, and Authority was firſt derived from the People, and diſorder'd Multitude; or either is originally ſtill in them, or elſe is deduc'd by their conſents naturally from them, and is not God's Ordinance originally deſcending from him, and depending upon him, he doth greatly err.</hi>

That the firſt King, that was in the World, <hi>Nimrod,</hi> made himſelf King by force. 2. That the greateſt part of Empires were erected by Conqueſt. 3. That Kings are eſtabliſhed by humane means, whether they attain to the Crown by Hereditary Succeſſion, or by Election, ſince there is no rule in the Word of God, that bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to follow an Hereditary Succeſſion more than an Election. 4. That there is no expreſs command ſet down to obey <hi>Henry,</hi> or <hi>Lewis,</hi> or to acknowledge this, or that Man more than another to be King. 5. That for theſe reaſons St. <hi>Peter</hi> calls the Obedience to Kings an <hi>Humane Order;</hi> while we on the contrary maintain, that Obedience due to Kings proceedeth from the Divine Law, and is grounded upon the Ordinance of God, and whom no Man may reſiſt without reſiſting God. <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.1, 2. and St. <hi>Peter</hi> in the ſame place, which they object againſt us, will have us yield Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the King for <hi>the Lord's ſake;</hi> and altho <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> was an ungodly King, a ſcourge uſed by God to deſtroy Nations, nevertheleſs God ſpeaks thus unto him by his Prophet (<hi>Dan.</hi> 2.37.) <hi>Thou,</hi> O <hi>King, art a King of Kings,</hi> &amp;c. — as to their reaſons. 1. It is falſe, that <hi>Nimrod</hi> was the firſt King in the World, for the Fathers, and Heads of Families were Kings, Prieſts, and Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:64059:60"/>Princes of their Families, Men living after the Flood Five or Six hundred Years, long enough to ſee a multitude of their own Children, over whom they were to exerciſe their paternal Power. 2. As to the eſtabliſhment of Government in Conqueſt, I ſay, that thoſe, whoſe Countries a ſtrange Prince ſeeketh to invade, do well to defend themſelves; and if in that defenſive War the Uſurper chance to be ſlain, he is juſtly puniſhed; but if he get the upper hand, if the Race of the Ancient Poſſeſſors of the ſame Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try be clean extinguiſhed, if the States of the Country aſſembled together, do agree upon a new form of Government, and if all the Officers throughout the Country have taken their Oaths of Fidelity to the New King, then we muſt believe, that God hath eſtabliſhed ſuch a Prince in that Kingdom, then I ſay, that the People ought to yield to the will of God, who for the ſins of Kings, and of their People tranſpoſeth Kingdoms, and diſpoſeth of the Iſſues of Battels at his will and pleaſure; as to the third, it belongs not to the Queſtion, whether a King ſucceed by Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, or by Election, but whether by the Ordinance of God we ought to obey him, when he is eſtabliſhed therein? while our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries will have the Power of <hi>Popes</hi> to proceed from the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of God, tho they enter into the Papacy by Election, and too often by indirect means, &amp;c. 4. Tho there be no command to obey <hi>Henry,</hi> or <hi>Lewis,</hi> it ſufficeth there is a commandment to obey the King, and to keep our Oaths of Fidelity made to the King, and by conſequence to be faithful to that King, to whom we ſwear Obedience and Loyalty;</q> [nay by this argument no King of this age were to be obeyed, becauſe we do not find his name expreſly ſet down in Holy Writ] <q>nay no Man were bound to fear God, or to believe in Jeſus Chriſt, becauſe the Scripture doth not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly ordain, that <hi>Thomas, Anthony,</hi> or <hi>William</hi> ſhould fear God, or believe in Jeſus Chriſt; it ſufficeth, that the Word of God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth general rules, which bind particular Perſons without nam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them. 5. St. <hi>Peter</hi> calls the Obedience, that Men owe to Kings, <hi>an humane Order,</hi> either becauſe Kings command divers things, which by their own nature are not derived from the Divine Law (as ſuppoſe, to forbid to go by night without a Candle) or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they attain to that Power by humane means, which hinders not, but that their Power is grounded upon the Word of God, after they are once eſtabliſhed; for the Queſtion is not touching the means,</q> whereby a Prince attains his Kingdom (<hi>i. e.</hi> whether by Hereditary Succeſſion, or Election] <q>but what Obedience is due

<pb n="118" facs="tcp:64059:64"/>flatter extremely, and repreſent themſelves to ordinary obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as the only Men for Loyalty and Love; but if we could ſearch, and ſee their hearts, we ſhould find them then moſt laborious to ſerve themſelves, and advance their own Ends, when they ſeem moſt zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous for their Sovereign's Service. <hi>Achitophel,</hi> in the ſunſhine of Peace and Calmneſs of the Kingdoms, did accommodate himſelf to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, both in Conſultations of State, and religious Conformity; but no ſooner had this hollow-hearted Man eſpy'd a dangerous Tempeſt, rais'd by <hi>Abſalom</hi>'s unnatural Treachery, but he turn'd Traytor to his natural Lord: When he obſerv'd the Wind to blow another way, he follow'd the blaſt, and ſet his Sails according to the Weather; which made <hi>David</hi> after complain; but it was thou, O Man, even my Companion, my Guide, and Familiar: We took ſweet Counſel together, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Wherefore let great Men, without Grace, profeſs and pretend what they will, and proteſt the Impoſſibility of any ſuch thing; as <hi>Hazael</hi> did in another Caſe; yet ordinarily, in ſuch tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multuous times, and of univerſal confuſion, for the ſecuring of their temporal happineſs; which without timely turning on God's ſide, is all the Heaven they are like to have in this World or the World to come. I ſay upon a point of great Advantage and Advancement with ſafety, they would fly from the declining State and down-fall of their old Maſter, tho formerly the mightieſt Monarch upon earth, as from the Ruins of a falling Houſe.

But now, he that truly fears God, would rather loſe his high Place, nay his Poſterity; as much Hearts-blood, if he had it, as would animate a whole Kingdom, than leave his lawful Sovereign Lord in ſuch a Caſe, upon any terms, tho he might have even the Imperial Crown ſet upon his own Head. For, Conſcience, that poor neglected thing, nay, in theſe laſt and looſer times, even laughed at by Men of the World; yet a ſtronger tye of Subjects hearts unto their Sovereigns, than Man or Devil is able to diſſolve; ever holds up his Loyal Heart erect and unſhaken, when all <hi>Shebnas, Hamans,</hi> and <hi>Achitophels</hi> would hide their heads, and ſhrink in the wetting.

                        <p>There are many obſervations worth the noting made by Biſhop <hi>Hacket</hi> on this Subject, in his Sermon on the day of the Coronation of King <hi>Charles</hi> I. on <hi>Pſ.</hi> 118.24. but I refer the Reader to the Diſcourſe it ſelf, while I relate what is recorded of him in his life written by Dr. <hi>Plume; that in the time of the great Rebellion,

If the adminiſtration of a Kingdom be out of frame, it is better to leave the redreſs to God, than to a ſeditious Multitude; the way to continue purity of Religion, being not by Rebellion, but by Martyrdom; to reſiſt law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Powers by ſeditious Arms, and unlawful Authority was not the Primitive, and Apoſtolical Chriſtianity, but Popiſh Doctrin, not taught the firſt three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years, but much about a thouſand years after Our Saviour's Aſcenſion into Heaven by the Pope of</hi> Rome, <hi>the very time, the Spirit of God ſays,</hi> Satan ſhould be let looſe, <hi>viz. by</hi> Gregory VII. <hi>who firſt taught the</hi> Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans <hi>to rebel againſt the Emperor</hi> Henry IV. — <hi>this poyſon was given the</hi> Engliſh <hi>People to drink out of the Papal cup, tho they pretended quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary; but Biſhop</hi> Hacket <hi>ever aſſerted, this was not the way to pull down</hi> Antichriſt, <hi>but Proteſtant Religion; and therefore he warn'd the Non-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming Divines to have a care, how they cryed up a War, and became fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous in the Congregation only, as</hi> Eroſtratus, <hi>by ſetting the Temple on fire.</hi>

Religion is a quiet, peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, governable thing: it teaches Men to ſuffer patiently, but not to Rebel. — It is evident it is not Religion, ſuch Men are zealous for, but a liberty in Religion; <hi>i. e.</hi> that every one may have his liberty to be of any Religion, or of none; which ſerves the Atheiſt's turn, as well as the Sectaries, but is not much for the honor, or intereſt of true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. — So that, whatever the pretences are, it is an ambitious,

Adding, it is plain, that he ſuppoſes, that the</hi> Britains, <hi>in that Confuſion they were in, took upon them, without regard to their Duty, to place, and diſplace them. — But withal he obſerves, that then the</hi> Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains <hi>were left to their full liberty by the</hi> Roman <hi>Empire, that there was no Line remaining to ſucceed in the Government, nor ſo much as to determine their Choice, which made them ſo eaſily to make, and unmake their Kings; who loſt their Purple, and their Lives together. This muſt needs breed inſinite confuſions among them, and every one who came to be King, lived in perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual fear of being ſerved as others had been before him.

<pb n="159" facs="tcp:64059:84"/>not rather of true Loyalty,—
<note n="‖" place="margin">Id. Vindi. p. 37. and anſ. to the 1ſt. part. p. 19.</note> the Doctrins of depoſing Princes, and abſolving Subjects from their Allegiance, are errors in matters of pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the higheſt importance;
<note n="*" place="margin">Id. anſ. to 2d. royal paper p. 40, 55.</note> — if fancy only keeps us firm to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> might it not as well have been ſaid, that the Proteſtants of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> adhered to the Crown in the times of Rebellion out of fancy, and not out of judgment? and that if their fancy chang'd, they might as well have joyned with the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels. — as we have cauſe to be thankful to God, when Kings are Nurſing Fathers to our Church; ſo we ſhall never ceaſe to pray for their continuing ſo, and that in all things we may behave our ſelves towards them, as becomes <hi>Good Chriſtians, and Loyal Subjects;</hi>
                           </q> and whereas the Defender of the Royal Papers. p. 80. argued againſt this, that Subjects were no longer according to this Doctrin to be Loyal, than their King is a Nurſing Father to their Church, <q>the Doctor wipes off the Aſperſion by telling him,
<note n="†" place="margin">Vindic. of the anſ. p. 101. ☜ P. 86.</note> that he had put an ill conſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction on his words far from the intention of the Author, who thinks it a part of a good Chriſtian, to be always a <hi>Loyal Subject.</hi> — I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire this Gentleman to reſolve me, whether in the late times of Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation this had been good Doctrin; that thoſe, who enjoy or pretend to Supreme Power, are to be judges in their own caſe? if ſo, then it had been impoſſible for Men to have juſtified their Loyalty to the Royal Family, then very unjuſtly put out of poſſeſſion,
<note place="margin">P. 88, 89.</note> — it is ſome comfort, that our Church is confeſſed to teach the Orthodox Doctrin of Loyalty, and her practice to be conformable thereto in the worſt of times; (and ſo the Doctor hopes, it will always be) — But it hath been ſaid by ſome body,
<note place="margin">☜</note> that we have nothing peculiar to our Church, but our Doctrin of <hi>Non-Reſiſtance;</hi> this might have given occaſion to inquire, whether the Church, which pretends to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible, doth teach it ſo Orthodoxly or not? or whether thoſe, who do think themſelves obliged to believe what ſhe teaches, are thereby obliged to the ſtricteſt Principles of Loyalty?
<note place="margin">☜</note> — this our Church doth not only teach them as her own Doctrin, but, which is far more effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual, as the Doctrin of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, and of the Primitive Church; which, I think, ought to have more force on the Conſciences of Men,
<note place="margin">P. 99.</note> than the pretence to Infallibility in any Church in the World.
<note place="margin">☜</note> — Is it any argument that the conſtitution of our Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is not firm, or that Loyal Subjects cannot be certain of their duty, becauſe <hi>Men of ill Principles</hi> have run away with falſe notions of a <hi>Fundamental contract and coordinate power?</hi>
                           </q> — and whereas it might be objected, that propoſitions as dangerous, as thoſe of the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> were held by ſome among our ſelves (witneſs thoſe condemn'd at <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford July.</hi> 26. 1683.) <q>We cannot deny, ſays he, but that there have been
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:64059:85"/>Men of ill Minds, and diſloyal Principles, Factious and Diſobedient, Enemies to the Government, both in Church and State; but have theſe Men ever had that countenance from the Doctrins of the guides of our Church, which the depoſing Doctrin hath had in the Church of <hi>Rome?</hi> To make the Caſe parallel, he muſt ſuppoſe our Houſes of Convocation to have ſeveral times declared theſe damnable Doctrins, and given encouragement to Rebels to proceed againſt their Kings, and the Univerſity of <hi>Oxford</hi> to have condemn'd them. — how come the Principles of the <hi>Regicides</hi> among us to be parallel'd with this Doctrin, when the Principles of our Church are ſo directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to them? and our Houſes of Convocation, would as readily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn any ſuch damnable Doctrins, as the Univerſity of <hi>Oxford?</hi> and all the World knows, how repugnant ſuch Principles are to thoſe of the Church of <hi>England. And none can be Rebels to their Prince, but they muſt be falſe to our Church.</hi>

                        <p>The ſame Author in his accurate <hi>Preface</hi> to the <hi>Jeſuits Loyalty;</hi> ſays,
<note place="margin">P. 1, 2.</note> that tho the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> walk in darkneſs, and do miſchief, <q>his inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was to ſet ſuch marks and characters upon them, that when o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſee them, they might take the wind of them, and avoid the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.—and that he publiſh'd the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> Treatiſes, becauſe ſome poyſons loſe their force, when they are expoſed to the open air; and thereupon addreſſing himſelf to the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> he endeavours to prove two things.
<note place="margin">P. 3.</note> 1. That if you do not renounce the Popes <hi>power of depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Princes, and abſolving Subjects from their Allegiance,</hi> you can give no real ſecurity to the Government. 2. That if you do renounce it, you have no reaſon to ſtick at the <hi>Oath of Allegiance,</hi> — to prove the firſt, he ſays, it is allowed by all Friends to our King and his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<note place="margin">☞</note> that the <hi>Commonwealth Principles</hi> are deſtructive to it, and that none, who do own them, can give ſufficient ſecurity for their Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance. I ſhall therefore prove, that all the miſchievous conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the <hi>Republican Principles</hi> do follow upon the owning the Pope's Power of <hi>depoſing Princes.</hi>
                              <note place="margin">P. 4.</note> — Now the miſchief of the <hi>Commonwealth Principles</hi> lay in theſe things. 1. Setting up a Court of Judicature over Sovereign Princes.
<note place="margin">☞</note> 2. Breaking the Oaths and Bonds of Allegiance Men had enter'd into. 3. Juſtifying Rebellion on the account of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. As to the firſt of ſetting up a <hi>Spiritual High-Court of Juſtice</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> it is no ſatisfaction in this caſe to diſtinguiſh of a <hi>direct</hi> and <hi>indirect</hi> power; for however the Power comes, the effect and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of it is the ſame. — The queſtion is, whether the Pope hath any ſuch Sovereignty over Princes, as to be able by virtue thereof to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe them; and the <hi>Commonwealth's Men</hi> do herein agree with you; for they do not ſay, that the People have a <hi>direct</hi> Power over their
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:64059:85"/>Princes (which were a contradiction in it ſelf, for Subjects to command their Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigns) but only, that <hi>in caſe of breach of Truſt,</hi> the People have an <hi>indirect</hi> power to call their Princes to an account, and to deprive them of their Authority; but are the Commonwealth Principles the leſs miſchievous to Government, becauſe they only aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert an <hi>indirect</hi> Power in the People? — the main thing to be debated is,
<note place="margin">P. 5.</note> whether Sovereign Princes have a Supreme, and Independent Authority Inherent in their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons or no; or whether they are ſo accountable to others, that upon <hi>male-adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> they may be deprived of their Government? — the Republicans, and Aſſertors of the <hi>Pope's depoſing Power</hi> are agreed in the Affirmative of the later Queſtion, and only differ, whether the Power be in the Pope, or the People to call Princes to an account — and even in this they do not differ ſo much, as Men may at firſt ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine; for however the Primitive Chriſtians thought it no flattery to Princes,
<note place="margin">☜</note> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive their Power immediatly from God, and to make them accountable to him alone, as being ſuperior to all below him (as might be eaſily proved by multitudes of teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies) yet after the <hi>Pope's depoſing Power</hi> came into requeſt, the <hi>Commonwealth Principles</hi> did ſo too, and the Power of Princes was ſaid to be of another Original, and therefore they were accountable to the People.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>Thus <hi>Gregory</hi> VII. <q>not only took upon him to depoſe the Emperor, and abſolve his Subjects from their Allegiance; but he makes the firſt conſtitution of Monarchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Government to be a mere Uſurpation upon the Rights and Liberties of the People. — and did ever any <hi>Remonſtrance, Declaration of the Army,
<note place="margin">P. 6.</note> or agreement of the People</hi> give a worſe account of the beginning of <hi>Monarchy,</hi> than this Infallible Head of the Church doth? What follows from hence, but the juſtifying all Rebellion againſt Princes, which upon theſe Principles, would be nothing elſe, but the Peoples reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering their <hi>juſt Rights</hi> againſt intolerable Uſurpations? — the very worſt of our <hi>Fanaticks</hi> never talk'd ſo reproachfully of Civil Government,
<note place="margin">☜</note> as your <hi>Canonized Saint</hi> doth; their Principles and Practices, we of the Church of <hi>England</hi> profeſs to deteſt and abhor. — I pray Gentlemen tell me, what divine aſſiſtance this good Pope had, when he gave this admirable account of the <hi>Original of Civil Government?</hi> and whether it be not very poſſible upon his Principles, for Men to be <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>Rebels</hi> at the ſame time.</q>
                        </p>
                        <q>
                           <p>I have had the curioſity to inquire into the Principles of <hi>Civil Government,</hi>
                              <note place="margin">P. 7.</note> among the fierce contenders for the <hi>Pope's depoſing Power,</hi> and I have found thoſe Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes avowed and maintained, which juſtifie all the Practices of our late <hi>Regicides.— Parſon's Book of the Succeſſion</hi> (to the making of which <hi>Cardinal Allen,</hi> Sir <hi>Francis Inglefield,</hi> and other Principal Perſons of our Nation concurred) being ſhred into ſo many Speeches to juſtifie their Proceedings againſt our Late Sovereign of Glorious Memory, the Book being deſign'd to exclude King <hi>James</hi> — and thus we ſee,
<note place="margin">P. 8.</note> the <hi>Pope's depoſing Power</hi> was maintain'd here in <hi>England</hi> by ſuch, who ſaw, how neceſſary it was for their purpoſe to defend the Power of <hi>Commonwealths</hi> over their Princes,
<note place="margin">☜</note> either to exclude them from Succeſſion to the Crown, or to deprive them of the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of it.</p>
                           <p>The ſame we ſhall find in <hi>France</hi> in the time of the <hi>ſolemn League and Covenant</hi> there, in the Reigns of <hi>Henry</hi> III. and IV. for thoſe, who were engaged ſo deep in Rebellion againſt their Lawful Princes, found it neceſſary for them to inſiſt on the <hi>Pope</hi>'s Power to <hi>depoſe,</hi> and the <hi>People</hi>'s to <hi>deprive</hi> their Sovereigns. — thus <hi>Boucher</hi> affirms, the <hi>fundamental and radical Power to be ſo in the People, that they may call Princes to account for Treaſon againſt the People. — and that in ſuch caſes they are not to ſtand upon the niceties, and forms of Law; but that the neceſſities of State do ſupercede all thoſe things.</hi> If this Man had been of Council for the late <hi>Regicides,</hi> he could not more effectually have Pleaded their Cauſe, — our Countryman <hi>William Reynolds</hi> alſo Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicating
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:64059:86"/>the Murther of <hi>Henry</hi> III. ſays, <hi>that Obedience to Princes is ſo far conditional, that if they do not their duty, their Subjects are free from their obligation to obey them; the contrary opinion being againſt the Law of Nations, and the Common reaſon of Mankind:</hi> and this is affirm'd by many others of their Writers.</p>

And ſo conſequently will the Impoſing any ſuch condition be, as inconſiſtent with the Rights of Sovereignty, — if they plead an <hi>implicite contract,</hi> who made ſuch conditional ſettlements of Civil Power upon Princes?
<note place="margin">☞</note> who keeps the ancient Deeds and Records of them? for all the firſt Ages of the Chriſtian Church, this <hi>conditional Power</hi> and <hi>Obedience</hi> was never heard of — not when Emperors were open, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared Infidels, or Hereticks; what reaſon can be ſuppoſed more now, than was in the times of <hi>Conſtantius,</hi> and <hi>Valens,</hi> that were <hi>Arian</hi> Hereticks? Yet the moſt Learned, Zealous, and Orthodox Biſhops of that time, never once thought of their loſing their Authority by it; as I could eaſily prove, if the deſign of this Preface would permit me.</p>
                           <p>If Chriſt and his Apoſtles were the beſt Teachers of Chriſtianity,
<note place="margin">P. 15</note> this is certainly no part of it, for the Religion they taught, never meddled with Crowns and Scepters, but left <hi>to Caeſar the things that were Caeſar</hi>'s, and never gave the leaſt intimation to Princes of any forfeiture of their Authority, if they did not <hi>reader to God the things that are God's.</hi> — it requires all Men, of what rank or order ſoever, to <hi>be ſubject to the Higher Powers,</hi>

<note place="margin">pag. 15.</note> — then let the Government have been formed when it will,
<note place="margin">☞</note> and by whom it will; yet, in ſuch a Caſe, becauſe the Governors have a juſt and undoubted Title to, and Poſſeſſion of their Supremacy, we cannot with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw our Subjection from them, unleſs we break the Law of God. — The only Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction that I can foreſee againſt this, is this, When the Actions of the Higher Powers, without any regard to the Laws of Juſtice, or the Government, do manifeſtly tend to the Subverſion of Juſtice and Right, and inſtead thereof, do load our Necks with In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries and Oppreſſions,
<note place="margin">pag. 16.</note> then we may fairly and honeſtly renounce our Subjection. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſpeak directly to the Objection, I muſt premiſe, 1. <hi>That that Deſign is juſtly ſuſp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

That it is as well an act of Subjection, peaceably and quietly to ſubmit to the Penalty, as it is actually to obey the Command.—Now, if our Adverſaries do not allow the Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to this disjunctive Subjection, it is apparent, that (when they tell us, we are not to be ſubject in the Caſe objected) their meaning is, we may defend our Diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience by Reſiſtance; and then the Objection put into plain <hi>Engliſh</hi> amounts to thus much, That whenever the Prince does not govern us according to the Laws of Juſtice, and thoſe of the Land,
<note place="margin">pag. 17.</note> there it is lawful for us to reſiſt and rebel againſt him. — This Doctrine is ſeditious and treaſonable, and likewiſe abſurd and falſe; for if a Subject does reſiſt his Prince, tho it be in ſuch a Caſe, in which it is ſuppoſed, that his Prince does him an Injury, he does by ſo doing ſtand guilty of theſe following Acts of Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice:</p>

For there is no doubt, but that the Title to the Sword is of right lodged in the Prince's Power; and there can be as little doubt, that the Subject can acquire no Right from the Injuſtice of the Prince to force it thence. For by the ſame Law that the Injuſtice of a Prince does entitle his Subjects to wreſt the Power of the Sword out of his hand againſt himſelf;
<note place="margin">pag. 19.</note> I ſay by the ſame Law, the Injuſtice of any private Man would give the <hi>injured</hi> Perſon a Title to the Eſtate and Life of the <hi>injurious.</hi> And ſo new Titles would continually ſtart up with new Injuries, and in a little time the Right to the whole World would (tho perhaps the poſſeſſion might not) belong to injur'd Perſons, as ſuch.</q>

<pb n="179" facs="tcp:64059:94"/>ſhould prove true, that the Prince by his Injury to the Rebel does forfeit his Title to his Government over <hi>him;</hi> yet there is another Enquiry behind, Whether or no, by ſuch his Injury, he forfeits his Title over the reſt of his Subjects; if he does, then he may forfeit his Title as well where he has not done an Injury, as where he has; —if he does not, then the reſiſtance of the Rebel is unjuſt.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>'There are ſeveral Concluſions that offer themſelves from the Doctrin already delivered,
<note place="margin">pag. 23.</note> the firſt is this:</p>
                        <p n="1">1. <q>Ought we to be ſubject for Conſcience ſake, and is therefore our Obligation to Subjection bound upon us by the hand of God himſelf? Then we may very fairly infer, that both the Doctrin and Practice of Reſiſtance comes from the Devil. For moſt undoubtedly any Practice or Doctrin does ſo, that ſtands in Diametrical Oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to any Duty that is laid upon us by God. — When People reſiſt their Prince, and at the ſame time pretend to fear God, ſuch their Pretenſions are not only falſe, but blaſphemous too.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2. <q>If we are bound in Conſcience to be ſubject to the Higher Powers,
<note place="margin">pag. 27</note> and if ſuch Obligation comes only from God, then we do infer, that no lawful Authority can be founded in mere outward Force: The reaſon is, becauſe our Duty of Subjection to lawful Authority ariſes from an Obligation of Conſcience. Now, tho a long Sword may have terror enough in it (in many Caſes at leaſt) to awe our outward Actions, yet it can never have Power enough to oblige our Conſciences. And tho it may, upon the account of our Intereſt, engage us to a Compliance, yet it will never be able, upon the account of our Conſciences, to engage us to an Obedience. For if mere Power can inſtate a Man in a juſt Title to the Supremacy, then it will follow, that whoever has Power enough to invade the Throne, has Right enough to poſſeſs it; and his Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation will therefore become lawful, becauſe his Strength hath made it poſſible; and ſo at length the Robbers Sword and Piſtol will come to be the only Standard of Juſtice, all other Power muſt be cancell'd, and we muſt come at laſt to make the Power of doing wrong to be the only meaſure of Equity and Right. All theſe things are at leaſt true,
<note place="margin">pag. 28.</note> when there is any Perſon in being, to whom the Title or Succeſſion of the Suprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy does belong, which (bleſſed be God) is our Caſe at preſent. And therefore that great Argument, which was brought to vindicate the Uſurpation of the ſucceſsful Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels in the late Wars, namely, that the People were not bound to adhere to their Prince, when the Prince was diſabled to defend the People, ſuppoſes no other Obligation upon Subjects than mere Intereſt; and ſo evacuates and makes null all Obligations of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. We ſhall therefore, before we part from this Inference, fix it as a certain Rule, by which every conſcientious Subject may and ought to guide his Practice: That ſo long as there is any Perſon of the Royal Race,
<note place="margin">☜</note> to whom by the Courſe of Succeſſion, according to the Tenor of the Law of the Land, the Crown does belong; ſo long we have a lawful Supremacy, and ſo long we ſhall be bound in Conſcience to be in Subjection.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p n="3">3. <q>Are we bound to be ſubject to the Higher Powers for Conſcience ſake, and does the Obligation of Conſcience come only from God? Then I do infer, that to bind the People to be in Subjection to their Prince, there is no neceſſity of any Bargain or <hi>Contract</hi> between them, and the reaſon is, becauſe that Obligation that binds the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to Obedience in this Caſe, is founded immediately and directly upon the Law of God.</q>

<note place="margin">☞</note> and who by being ſuch, muſt, I am ſure, by Principle be obedient Subjects. As for this Author, he has made a broad Sign, that he intends to leave us, by inſinuating, that the Charge of Idolatry ought to be follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Blowes. — We, who do proteſt againſt certain Practices, as idolatrous, do alſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt againſt violating Loyalty upon the account of Religion.—Did we indeed profeſs that of Idolatry, which ſome others do of Hereſie, that it is a ſufficient ground for the Excommunicating of a King, and the abſolving his Subjects of their Allegiance; had we ever been caught, not in <hi>Oateſian Conſpiracies,</hi> but in real Plots againſt our Sovereign upon this account, there might then have been juſt cauſe for ſuch an inſinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But whilſt our Principles are ſo loyal, that we have even been laught at for our aſſerting them — it was a very unreaſonable apprehenſion to think, that the Charge of Idolatry ſhould in the bottom have been the deſign againſt the Monarchy, which we have ſo often declared, and in the Perſon of our preſent King, have ſhewn, we think our ſelves obliged to ſupport, whatever his Religion be, who is to ſit upon the Throne. — The truth is, when I conſider, how heinous a Suggeſtion this is, and what little Foundation there is, either from our <hi>Principles</hi> or our <hi>Practices</hi> to ſupport it, I am under ſome temptation to reply to this Author, <hi>Nemo hoc poteſt credere, niſi qui poſſit audere;</hi> and this, I hope, may ſerve for my excuſe, if I have at this time appear'd in defence of a Charge, in which, every true Member of the Church of <hi>England</hi> is ſo highly concern'd. —Let the ſame Mind be in us,
